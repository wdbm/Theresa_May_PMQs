1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,460
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,400
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
later today.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
>>Peter Grant (Glenrothes) (SNP): “Bairns
come first” is the title of a report recently

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,680
produced by a number of organisations, including
Fife Gingerbread and Citizens Advice and Rights

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,029
Fife. It found that a third of families who
should have been claiming child maintenance

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:31,230
support did not apply, that a major barrier
to applying was the £20 application fee,

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,370
and that the 4% collection fee had a serious
impact on family budgets. Will the Prime Minister

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,309
undertake to review those unfair charges?

10
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:46,800
>>The Prime Minister: Trying to ensure that
those responsible for children actually pay

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,750
for their children when a family has broken
up has been a long-standing question which

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,239
this House has addressed. There have been
various ways of dealing with it through the

13
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,410
agency that has been responsible. It is right
that the changes that have been introduced

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,830
are on a more level basis and more people
are able to access the support they need as

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,830
a result.

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,970
>>Daniel Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham)
(Con): The Government have rightly focused

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,390
on economic growth, jobs and prosperity—something
all of us on the Conservative Benches can

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,390
get behind. With that in mind, will the Prime
Minister back our highly competitive bid for

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,740
funding for the north-west relief road in
Shrewsbury, which will not only deal with

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,829
the congestion our town is facing but dovetail
into that narrative?

21
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:35,893
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising that. I know that the issue of

22
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:40,490
the north-west relief road in Shrewsbury has
been of particular concern to him; it is a

23
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,290
priority for him and it has received considerable
local backing. I understand that the local

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,329
Marches LEP has put in a bid for feasibility
funding so that it can prepare a business

25
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:54,020
case for the scheme. What I can say at the
moment is that the announcement of the successful

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,680
bids for feasibility funding is expected very
shortly indeed.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:14,040
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): The
Government’s sustainability and transformation

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,360
plans for the national health service hide
£22 billion of cuts to our service, according

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,610
to research by the British Medical Association.
That risks

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,130
“starving services of resources and patients
of vital care.”

31
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,930
That quote comes from Dr Mark Porter of the
BMA. When he calls this process “a mess”,

32
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,930
where is he wrong?

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,580
>>The Prime Minister: The national health
service is indeed looking for savings within

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:52,260
the NHS which will be reinvested in the NHS,
and I remind the right hon. Gentleman that

35
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,739
it is this Government who are providing not
just the £8 billion of extra funding that

36
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:04,560
the NHS requested, but £10 billion of extra
funding. Sustainability and transformation

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,459
plans are being developed at local level in
the interests of local people by local clinicians.

38
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,880
>>Jeremy Corbyn: It is very strange that the
Prime Minister should say that, because the

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,071
Select Committee on Health, chaired by her
hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston),

40
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:27,510
says that the figure is actually £4.5 billion,
not £10 billion; there is quite a big difference

41
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,510
there.

42
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,380
Part of the reason for the strain on our national
health service is that more than 1 million

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,100
people are not receiving the social care they
need. As a result of that, there has been

44
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,120
an increase in emergency admissions for older
patients. Margaret wrote to me this week—[Interruption.]

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:04:00,159
It is not funny. She described how her 89-year-old
mother suffered two falls leading to hospital

46
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,230
admissions due to the lack of nursing care,
and went on to say,

47
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,450
“My mother is worth more than this.”

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,790
What action will the Prime Minister take to
stop the neglect of older people, which ends

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,769
up forcing them into A&amp;E admissions when
they should be cared for at home or in a care

50
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,769
home?

51
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:28,270
>>The Prime Minister: Of course social care
is an area of concern, and it is a key issue

52
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,000
for many people. That is why the Government
have introduced the better care fund and the

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,740
social care precept for local authorities,
and why we are encouraging the health service

54
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,280
and local authorities to work together to
deal with precisely the social care and bed

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,500
blocking issues that the right hon. Gentleman
has raised.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,270
We have introduced the better care fund and
the social care precept, but let us just look

57
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:07,050
at what the Labour Government did in their
13 years. They said that they would deal with

58
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,600
social care in their 1997 manifesto. They
introduced a royal commission in 1999, a Green

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,289
Paper in 2005 and the Wanless review in 2006.
They said they would sort it in the comprehensive

60
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:24,259
spending review of 2007, and produced another
Green Paper in 2009. Thirteen years, and they

61
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,880
did nothing.

62
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:36,610
>>Jeremy Corbyn: As the Prime Minister well
knows, health spending trebled under the last

63
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:47,370
Labour Government and the levels of satisfaction
with the health service were at their highest

64
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:58,520
ever in 2010. This Government’s choice was
to cut social care by £4.6 billion in the

65
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,280
last Parliament, at the same time as they
found the space, shall we say, to cut billions

66
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,810
from corporate taxation bills. This is affecting
patients leaving hospital as well. In the

67
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,460
last four years, the number of patients unable
to be transferred from hospital due to the

68
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,330
lack of adequate social care has increased
by one third. Will the Prime Minister ensure

69
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,169
that her Government will guarantee all our
elderly people the dignity they deserve?

70
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:37,360
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the importance
of caring for elderly people and providing

71
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,110
them with the dignity they deserve. The right
hon. Gentleman says that this Government have

72
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,979
done nothing on social care, but I repeat
that we have introduced the social care precept,

73
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:52,949
which is being made use of by my local authorities
and by his local authority. We have also introduced

74
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,710
the better care fund. He talks about support
for elderly people, but let me remind him

75
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,270
which Government it was who put in place the
triple lock for pensioners. That has ensured

76
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,800
the largest increase in pensions for elderly
people.

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,819
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The precept is a drop in
the ocean compared with what is necessary

78
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,819
for social care. I shall give Members an example.
I am sure the whole House will have been appalled

79
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,070
by the revelations in the BBC’s “Panorama”
programme this week. They showed older people

80
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,580
being systematically mistreated. The Care
Quality Commission’s assessment is that

81
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,630
the care homes run by the Morleigh Group “require
improvement”, and it has issued warning

82
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,660
notices. The commission goes on to say that
the owner

83
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,180
“has allowed the services to deteriorate
even further. She has utterly neglected her

84
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,740
duty of care to the residents of these homes.”

85
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,729
What action are the Government going to take
to protect the residents of those homes?

86
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,470
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
raises the issue of the quality of care that

87
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,710
is provided in homes and the way in which
elderly people are treated. I am sure everybody

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,810
is appalled when we see examples of poor and
terrible treatment being given to elderly

89
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,500
and vulnerable people in care homes. What
we do about it is ensure that the Care Quality

90
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,860
Commission is able to step in and take action
and that it has powers to ensure that nobody

91
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,849
in the chain of responsibility is immune from
legal accountability. We know that there is

92
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,740
more that can be done, and that is why the
CQC is looking into ways of improving its

93
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,060
processes and increasing its efficiency. The
Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon.

94
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,879
Friend the Member for Warrington South (David
Mowat), the Minister for community health

95
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:44,529
and care, will be writing to the CQC shortly
to see how we can improve what it does. It

96
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,350
is the CQC that deals with these issues, and
we have that in place. Is there more we can

97
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,459
do? Yes, and we are doing it.

98
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:57,510
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The problem seems to be that
that home was understaffed. We should not

99
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,029
blame often underpaid and hard-pressed care
workers; we should be ensuring that there

100
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,840
are enough of them—properly paid—in all
such homes. There was a serious problem of

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,709
understaffing, and it was the last Labour
Government who established the CQC. A warning

102
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,720
notice is insufficient—we need stronger
action than that.

103
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,810
Yesterday, the Government proposed that patients
may have to show passports or other ID to

104
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,980
access non-emergency healthcare. Have the
Government considered the impact on elderly

105
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,390
people? The last census showed us that 9.5
million people in this country do not have

106
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,500
passports. Instead of distracting people with
divisive, impractical policies, could the

107
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,830
Prime Minister provide the NHS and social
care with the money that it needs to care

108
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,960
for the people who need the support?

109
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,540
>>The Prime Minister: Over this Parliament,
the Government will be spending half a trillion

110
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,870
pounds on the national health service. The
right hon. Gentleman asks about a process

111
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,950
to ensure that people who are receiving NHS
treatment are entitled to receive that NHS

112
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,730
treatment. For many years, there has been
concern about health tourism and about people

113
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,700
turning up in the UK and accessing health
services but not paying for them. We want

114
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,230
to ensure not only that those who are entitled
to use the services are indeed able to see

115
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,630
them free at the point of delivery, but that
we deal with health tourism and those who

116
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,100
should be paying for the use of our health
service.

117
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,360
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Simon Stevens told us two
weeks ago that the next three years will be

118
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,320
the toughest ever for NHS funding and that
2018 would see health spending per person

119
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,490
cut for the first time ever in this country.
The National Audit Office has reported that

120
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,850
the cost of health tourism is over a hundred
times less than the £22 billion of cuts that

121
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:08,330
the NHS faces from this Government. The reality
is that under this Government there are 6,000

122
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:16,170
fewer mental health nurses and a record 3.9
million people on NHS waiting lists. All of

123
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,910
us who visit A&amp;E departments know the
stress that staff are under and that waiting

124
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:28,190
times are getting longer and longer. One million
people in this country are not receiving the

125
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,240
social care that they need. Instead of looking
for excuses and scapegoats, should not the

126
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,220
Prime Minister be ensuring that health and
social care is properly resourced and properly

127
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:46,700
funded, to take away the stress and fear that
people face in old age and the stress that

128
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,050
is placed on our very hard-working NHS and
social care staff?

129
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:59,700
>>The Prime Minister: Billions of pounds extra
into social care through the social care precept

130
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,880
and the better care fund; half a trillion
pounds being spent on the national health

131
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,440
service; a record level of investment in mental
health in the national health service—[Interruption.]

132
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,200
>>Mr Speaker: Order. Members must not shout
down or attempt to shout down the Prime Minister.

133
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,139
The question has been asked and was heard,
and the answer must be heard.

134
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,160
>>The Prime Minister: There is a fundamental
point that the right hon. Gentleman refrains

135
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,140
from mentioning: we can afford to pay for
the national health service and for social

136
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:39,269
care only if we have a strong economy creating
wealth, and that is precisely what he is going

137
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:49,160
to hear from the Chancellor of the Exchequer
in a few minutes’ time.

138
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,930
>>Gordon Henderson (Sittingbourne and Sheppey)
(Con): On 23 June, my constituents voted by

139
00:12:51,930 --> 00:13:03,570
a margin of 62% to 28% to leave the European
Union. Many of those people are unhappy and

140
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:09,790
frustrated by what they see as delaying tactics
from some remainers, who do not seem to understand

141
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,590
the meaning of the word “democracy”—[Interruption.]

142
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,110
>>Mr Speaker: Order. This is very discourteous.
The hon. Gentleman has a legitimate question

143
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,630
and it and every other question should be
heard fully and with politeness.

144
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:33,541
>>Gordon Henderson: Thank you, Mr Speaker—and
I will repeat it. Some remainers do not seem

145
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:38,940
to understand the meaning of the word “democracy”,
which I would remind them is government by

146
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,870
the people, especially the rule of the majority.
With that in mind, what reassurance can my

147
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,519
right hon. Friend give my constituents and
me that article 50 will be triggered by March

148
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,860
next year?

149
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,200
>>The Prime Minister: I am clear that we will
trigger article 50 by the end of March next

150
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:06,690
year. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to
make the key point: it was decided by this

151
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,050
Parliament, six to one, that the people should
have the opportunity to vote on membership

152
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,680
of the European Union. The vote was held,
the turnout was high and the public gave their

153
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,432
verdict. There must be no second referendum
and no attempt to weasel out of this, and

154
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:24,990
this is the Government who will deliver on
the vote of the British people.

155
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,070
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): We on the
Scottish National party Benches have repeatedly

156
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:36,990
brought up the issue of the devastating impact
on disabled people of the UK benefits system.

157
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:43,010
The Government plan to cut support for people
with long-term health difficulties by £30

158
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,760
a week. Last week, my hon. Friend the Member
for Airdrie and Shotts (Neil Gray) proposed

159
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,459
a motion, which was passed by this House with
support from both Labour and Conservative

160
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:58,740
Members, for these cuts to be postponed. Will
the Prime Minister act on the vote of this

161
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
House?

162
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,029
>>The Prime Minister: Let me tell the right
hon. Gentleman what we have been doing in

163
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:08,839
relation to benefits for disabled people:
the overall funding for disability benefits

164
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,910
will be higher in every year up to 2020 than
it was in 2010; we have been focusing support

165
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,730
on those who most need it—those who are
not able to get into the workplace; and for

166
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,260
those who are able, at some stage, to get
into the workplace, we have been providing

167
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,550
a wider package of support. I am pleased to
say that over the last three years nearly

168
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,560
600,000 more disabled people are now in the
workplace, with the dignity of having a job,

169
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,139
which is what many people with disabilities
want to have. So we are focusing help on those

170
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,339
who most need it and helping those with disabilities
who want to get into the workplace to do just

171
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,339
that.

172
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,970
>>Angus Robertson: But it is widely trailed
that the Prime Minister will make changes

173
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:53,930
that will impact on benefit recipients in
work. Will she confirm that she has no intention

174
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,769
of helping people with disabilities and medical
conditions? Why should people who are unable

175
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,570
to earn a living be punished for their disability
or illness by losing £30 a week? Does she

176
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,589
have any intention of changing that?

177
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,920
>>The Prime Minister: I have just set out
for the right hon. Gentleman the ways in which

178
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,350
we are providing support and help for those
people who have disabilities. As I said, the

179
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,209
overall spending on disability benefits will
be higher in every year to 2020 than it was

180
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,459
in 2010. But it is also important to recognise
that when we give support for people with

181
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:35,110
disabilities, it is not simply about the benefits
system and how much money they are given;

182
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,620
for those who are able to get into work and
are on that part of the employment and support

183
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,200
allowance, we provide packages that are outside
the benefits as well, because we recognise

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,600
that people want the dignity of getting into
the workplace. That is what we are helping

185
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,220
people with disabilities who can work to do.

186
00:16:52,220 --> 00:17:04,750
>>Sir Simon Burns (Chelmsford) (Con): Does
my right hon. Friend agree that thousands

187
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:12,199
of road commuters, including many of my constituents
who use the A12, are travelling on roads that

188
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:19,890
need to be repaired and upgraded? To improve
connectivity and to speed up daily commute

189
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:30,360
times, does she accept that the proposed £1.3
billion investment in improving our road network

190
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,130
is warmly welcome and will do a great deal
to enhance connectivity in the country?

191
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:44,919
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
is absolutely right about the importance of

192
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,100
infrastructure expenditure in helping to deal
with productivity in our economy, and I am

193
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,620
pleased that that £1.3 billion for new roads
does show us investing in the long-term future

194
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:02,230
for Britain. It is about delivering jobs and
economic growth, and about making sure that

195
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,410
this economy works for everyone. It is just
one part of the package that we are proposing,

196
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,410
but of course my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
will be setting our proposals out more clearly

197
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,910
in a few minutes’ time.

198
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,240
>>Tulip Siddiq (Hampstead and Kilburn) (Lab):
My constituent Nazanin Ratcliffe, a British

199
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:26,820
national, is in prison in Iran. She has been
separated from her husband and her two-year-old

200
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,110
daughter for eight months. She has been on
hunger strike and is now suicidal. The Prime

201
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:42,120
Minister needs to reunite this mother, this
daughter and this wife with her family. Will

202
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,770
it take Nazanin’s death for the Government
to start taking her seriously?

203
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,419
>>The Prime Minister: Obviously, this is a
very difficult time for the whole family.

204
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,211
I am sure that we are all concerned about
the reports of the impact that detention in

205
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:06,421
Iran is having on Nazanin Ratcliffe’s health.
This is an issue that has repeatedly been

206
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:09,880
raised with the Iranian Government by the
UK Government—by both the previous Foreign

207
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,020
Secretary and the current Foreign Secretary.
I personally raised it with President Rouhani

208
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,049
on 20 September in New York, and I stressed
the importance of finding a resolution as

209
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,470
soon as possible. I have since written to
President Rouhani requesting confirmation

210
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,520
of the charges, the sentence and the appeals
process, and I have asked for assurances that

211
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,270
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe will be allowed full
legal representation and regular contact with

212
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,380
her family. We will continue to do everything
that we can for the family and that includes

213
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,300
the British Government remaining ready to
help to bring back Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s

214
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,059
daughter to Britain if that is the request.

215
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,679
>>Mr Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden)
(Con): Does my right hon. Friend agree that

216
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,950
most of our social problems are either caused
or aggravated by the acute shortage of housing,

217
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,680
so even if we manage to reduce the net immigration
to this country, as I hope we will, we will

218
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,710
have to build far more new homes? Is not the
recommendation by the European Banking Authority

219
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:16,460
to increase by 50% the reserves that banks
must hold against house building, which makes

220
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,330
it even more costly for them to lend for housing
than for unsecured credit cards, profoundly

221
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,590
unhelpful and perverse?

222
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:31,710
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure my right hon.
Friend will recognise that we are subject

223
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,490
to our own Prudential Regulation Authority,
but the overall point that he makes about

224
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,520
the importance of house building is absolutely
correct. We do need to build more homes. That

225
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,240
is something that the Government have been
doing. We have seen something like 900,000

226
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,710
new homes being built since 2010, but there
is more for us to do, and that is what this

227
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,000
Government are working on.

228
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,100
>>Angela Smith (Penistone and Stocksbridge)
(Lab): The Brexit Secretary and the Foreign

229
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Secretary are described by a senior German
politician as having no idea what Brexit really

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,919
means. The Times reports today that EU ambassadors
think that the Foreign Secretary’s more

231
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,730
colourful outbursts are damaging our relationships
with member states. When will the Prime Minister

232
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:26,530
get a grip on her Ministers and demonstrate
to the country and to our EU colleagues that

233
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,480
she has a coherent, workable plan for Brexit?

234
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,190
>>The Prime Minister: I have been very clear
in this House on many occasions about the

235
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,150
plan that we have for Brexit. Crucially, we
will be leaving the European Union and we

236
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,330
will be triggering article 50 by the end of
March next year, and that is when the formal

237
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,750
negotiations will start. It is absolutely
right that we do not set out at this stage

238
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,560
every single detail of our proposed negotiating
strategy, because that would be the best way

239
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,090
to get the worst possible deal for Britain.

240
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,809
>>Mrs Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham)
(Con): As we leave the European Union, maintaining

241
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,789
the UK’s cutting edge and world leadership
in scientific and technological discovery

242
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:16,280
is of paramount importance to our industries
and universities. May I welcome the Prime

243
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,090
Minister’s announcement that, each year,
we will invest a further £2 billion in research

244
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:27,169
and development to boost our science and engineering
base? Is not this just the type of vital support

245
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,799
that our businesses and researchers need,
rather than the threats from the Labour party

246
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:38,059
to slash the R and D tax credits, which would
hamper innovation and harm our economy?

247
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,140
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
is absolutely right. The extra investment

248
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,640
that we will be putting into research and
development is a crucial part of our long-term

249
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,110
task of ensuring that we have the economy
and the growth and prosperity that we need

250
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,130
in this country. The new funds will help to
put us at the cutting edge of scientific discovery.

251
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:08,800
That is already happening. I visited the Wellcome
Genome Campus in Cambridge on Monday and saw

252
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,080
for myself the really exciting and transformational
work that is being done, and it is coming

253
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,520
out of the knowledge base and the scientific
research of the United Kingdom. We want to

254
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,100
see more of that, which is why we will be
investing in it.

255
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:27,789
>>John Woodcock (Barrow and Furness) (Lab/Co-op):
Aleppo’s hospitals are destroyed and Syrians

256
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:34,049
who avoid the barrel bombs and the chlorine
gas are starving from the Russian-backed blockade.

257
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:41,750
We must do more. Will the Prime Minister revisit
the prospect for aid drops, and will she look

258
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:49,909
at backing the campaign to stop this daily
perpetrator of war crimes by stripping it

259
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:53,500
of its right to hold the 2018 World cup?

260
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,310
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman is
right to raise the issue of the appalling

261
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,720
atrocities that are taking place in Aleppo,
and it is right that we, along with our international

262
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,500
allies, should be doing all that we can to
try to bring this to a stop. He will recognise

263
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,210
that the issue of who hosts sporting events
is not in the Government’s remit. What is

264
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,950
in the Government’s remit and what we are
doing, as I say, is working with our international

265
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,930
allies to put more pressure on Russia to stop
the appalling atrocities—the appalling attacks—that

266
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:29,240
are taking place in Aleppo. What we want to
see is an agreement for a political transition

267
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,850
to a Syria without President Assad.

268
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:35,950
>>Mr John Whittingdale (Maldon) (Con): Does
my right hon. Friend agree that if the UK

269
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:41,990
is to remain competitive and our citizens
are to enjoy the benefits of the digital revolution,

270
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,220
it is essential that we should be at the forefront
of the deployment of both ultra-fast broadband

271
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,490
and 5G mobile connectivity? May I therefore
welcome the announcement, which we are led

272
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,830
to believe may be made shortly, of a £1 billion
investment to achieve this?

273
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,700
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
will, of course, be waiting in anticipation

274
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,279
for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor’s
autumn statement, but he is absolutely right

275
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,420
that, as we look at improving productivity
in this country and as we look to the economy

276
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:23,220
of the future, the provision of superfast
broadband and those new technological opportunities

277
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,690
for people is absolutely a crucial part of
that, and that is something that this Government

278
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,300
recognise and will act on.

279
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,059
>>Holly Lynch (Halifax) (Lab): One day last
week, four police officers in my constituency

280
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:39,440
were assaulted over a single 24-hour period.
There were over 23,000 assaults on police

281
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,900
officers last year, and an assault on a police
officer is an assault on society. What will

282
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,190
the Prime Minister do to ensure that the toughest
deterrents are in place to protect front-line

283
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,330
officers, and when will she reduce the need
for unsafe single crewing by restoring the

284
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,580
number of police on our streets?

285
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,789
>>The Prime Minister: May I send our best
wishes to those police officers who were assaulted

286
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,840
in the hon. Lady’s constituency last week?
It is important that we recognise that when

287
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,600
police officers go out on duty—and, indeed,
for many off duty—they sometimes find themselves

288
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,590
intervening in situations where they are on
the receiving end of assaults and violence

289
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,470
against them. They are willing to go forward
in the line of duty, where others are not,

290
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:28,960
and we recognise that. One of the things we
want to do in relation to this is to identify

291
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,150
rather better the number of assaults that
are taking place. That is why last year we

292
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,430
issued some provisional figures. We are improving
those figures now this year. Sentencing guidelines

293
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,020
already allow for an assault on a police officer
to be taken as an aggravating factor into

294
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,950
account, but also new developments, like the
body-worn videos, actually help to provide

295
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,210
the evidence that ensures that people can
be brought to justice and that actually deter

296
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,570
assaults in the first place.

297
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,140
>>Dr Andrew Murrison (South West Wiltshire)
(Con): I know that the Prime Minister shares

298
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,500
my concern at the level of acute hospital
bed blocking. Does she agree that part of

299
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,850
the solution is to promote community hospital
beds, where they still exist in places such

300
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,740
as Warminster and Shaftesbury, as part of
the sustainability and transformation planning

301
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
process?

302
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,660
>>The Prime Minister: As regards the STP process,
of course, that will take place at local level—it

303
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,679
will be at the local level that these proposals
will be considered and put forward by local

304
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,220
clinicians—but the concept of being able
to deal with bed blocking in a variety of

305
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,299
ways is absolutely right. There are good examples
around the country of where having those step-down

306
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:42,090
beds available is actually resolving the problem
of bed blocking. There are other ways in which

307
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,529
that is being done—in those parts of the
country where social workers are being employed

308
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:50,750
by hospital trusts, for example. But is it
very good to recognise the good practice when

309
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,630
it is being done, and we shall see more of
that across the country.

310
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,289
>>Tom Elliott (Fermanagh and South Tyrone)
(UUP): Earlier this month, IRA man turned

311
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:04,809
lawyer, Kieran Conway, confessed to the BBC
that he took part in robberies, bombings and

312
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:10,230
gun attacks that murdered British soldiers.
He stated that he will never disclose information

313
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:17,659
on any fellow IRA man, despite knowing details
of IRA actions that he defines as constituting

314
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,799
war crimes. Can the Prime Minister assure
me that Her Majesty’s Government will apply

315
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,200
for the extradition of this terrorist for
questioning from the Republic of Ireland?

316
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,120
>>The Prime Minister: The question of whether
or not an individual would be extradited or

317
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,120
a request would be made for extradition is
for the appropriate investigation and prosecution

318
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:48,830
authorities to decide. We do, of course, recognise
the concerns about those cases where it is

319
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,210
still possible to bring people to justice,
and obviously we want to see that being done.

320
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,900
>>John Stevenson (Carlisle) (Con): During
the past six years we have had three major

321
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,010
referendums, all eliciting varying degrees
of excitement. Does the Prime Minister agree

322
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:08,530
that one can have too much excitement, and
will she therefore rule out any further referendums

323
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,790
in this Parliament?

324
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:18,970
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is trying
to tempt me down a particular route. One thing

325
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,789
that I will certainly rule out is a second
referendum on whether we leave the European

326
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:24,070
Union.

327
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:33,220
>>Kirsty Blackman (Aberdeen North) (SNP):
Aberdeen Cyrenians have launched a financial

328
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,740
appeal because of the increasing number of
people finding themselves homeless as a direct

329
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,510
result of the UK Government’s pursuit of
austerity. How can the Prime Minister sleep

330
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,429
in her warm bed at night knowing that her
Government’s policies have consigned people

331
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:45,429
to a cold Christmas?

332
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:54,290
>>The Prime Minister: The 
Government are taking action in a variety

333
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,770
of ways to address homelessness. One of the
key things we need to do is ensure that we

334
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:06,669
see more homes being built in this country.
The hon. Lady talks about austerity in the

335
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:21,330
tone that she uses, but austerity is about
us living within our means. When we talk about

336
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,940
the Government providing support for individuals,
we should always remember that taxpayers have

337
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,679
to pay for that support, and many taxpayers
are themselves struggling to get by.

338
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,710
>>Kevin Foster (Torbay) (Con): The Prime Minister
will be aware that yesterday the Peninsula

339
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,529
Rail Task Force launched its report, which
was commissioned following the storms that

340
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,679
severed Devon and Cornwall’s vital rail
link, just as our vital rail link was severed

341
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,510
again, this time by flooding. Does she welcome
the report and will she commit the Government

342
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,210
to ensuring that the vision it outlines is
delivered?

343
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,929
>>The Prime Minister: May I suggest that my
hon. Friend exercises a little more patience

344
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,529
and listens very carefully to what my right
hon. Friend the Chancellor has to say?

345
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:08,490
>>Wayne David (Caerphilly) (Lab): In these
uncertain times we would all surely agree

346
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,640
that Britain needs strong defence, so how
can the Prime Minister justify her Government’s

347
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,779
decision to scrap all the Navy’s heavyweight
surface-to-surface guided missiles without

348
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,010
any replacement?

349
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:26,059
>>The Prime Minister: I do not recognise the
picture that the hon. Gentleman presents of

350
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:30,770
what the Government are doing in relation
to the armed forces. We are investing billions

351
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,240
of pounds in ensuring that our armed forces
do have the missiles, the ships for the Royal

352
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,891
Navy and the other pieces of equipment for
the other armed forces. The picture that he

353
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:44,549
presents is not the picture I recognise.

354
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:52,299
>>Mr Julian Brazier (Canterbury) (Con): Does
my right hon. Friend agree that it would be

355
00:31:52,299 --> 00:32:00,840
good for confidence in the rule of law if
judges did not enter into speculative public

356
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,480
thoughts on cases that they are about to hear?

357
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,289
>>The Prime Minister: In this country we value
the independence of our judiciary—that is,

358
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:17,149
the independence of members of the judiciary
when they come to make their judgments in

359
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:22,700
court. Also, they are independent and it is
for them to determine what they choose to

360
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,080
put in their speeches. It is not for the Government
to tell them what to do.

361
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:35,299
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
As millions of public sector workers face

362
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:42,820
another year of suppressed pay, after another
week of shambolic Brexit negotiations, and

363
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:49,740
with the national health service facing a
winter crisis and crying out for cash, does

364
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,210
the Prime Minister worry that her Government
are only just about managing?

365
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:05,659
>>The Prime Minister: We are very clear about
the amounts of money that we are putting into

366
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:09,690
the national health service. The hon. Gentleman
talks about the negotiations. Actually, the

367
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,700
negotiations for us leaving the European Union
do not formally start until we trigger article

368
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,919
50. We will trigger article 50 by the end
of March next year. The hon. Gentleman wants

369
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:27,370
to stop us leaving the European Union by denying
the people the decision and the deliverability

370
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,350
of the vote that they took, rightly, on 23
June. He wants to deny people what they want;

371
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,820
we are going to give it to them.

372
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,110
>>Charlie Elphicke (Dover) (Con): May I raise
with the Prime Minister the concerns of millions

373
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:44,289
of drivers and hauliers across the United
Kingdom who worry about the cost of driving

374
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:49,220
and fuel duty? Will the Government look at
keeping that down? Will they also look at

375
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,049
how forecourt pricing has worked as the oil
price changes? The prices jump like a rocket

376
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,870
and fall like a feather.

377
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,409
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise that, as
my hon. Friend says, many people look with

378
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:06,580
very great concern at the cost of motoring
in this country. I suggest, as I have to some

379
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,339
of my other hon. Friends, that he should be
a little more patient and wait for the Chancellor’s

380
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,349
autumn statement.

381
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:19,050
>>Ms Angela Eagle (Wallasey) (Lab): The Prime
Minister has talked about her worries about

382
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:25,560
social care, but surely we have to judge her
by her actions. In the last six years there

383
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:33,630
has been an average 37% cut in local authority
funding—57% in my area—and nearly a quarter

384
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:38,890
of all those older people in need of social
care have been denied any help at all. What

385
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,919
is she going to do about it?

386
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,310
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady might
have noticed that I have been asked several

387
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:52,829
questions about social care—[Interruption]—and
I 

388
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,550
will give the answer that I have given previously.
What the Government are doing about social

389
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,510
care is to put more money in through the better
care fund, to give local authorities the opportunity

390
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,880
that is in the social care precept and to
make sure that health and social care come

391
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,570
together to ensure that we deal with the issue
of bed blocking.

392
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,990
>>Richard Drax (South Dorset) (Con): How many
of us would charge into a darkened store at

393
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:23,570
night knowing that inside were three mask-wearing,
crowbar-wielding thugs trying to rob it? My

394
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,390
two constituents, Nigel Dunmore and Grant
McGarry, did just that; as a result of their

395
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,590
intervention, the thugs fled, leaving the
money, and the staff were hurt less, although

396
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,990
one of the gentlemen was himself hurt. Will
my right hon. Friend join me in praising their

397
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,640
courage and selflessness in carrying out this
extraordinary act of bravado?

398
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:58,859
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely agree with
my hon. Friend and I commend the bravery and

399
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:04,090
courage shown by those two individuals—Nigel
and Grant, I think he said—who stepped into

400
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,980
that situation to ensure that it was not as
bad as it might have been. That is incredible

401
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,590
bravery; many members of the public would
not have been willing to step forward in that

402
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,680
way. Will he pass my best wishes—and the
best wishes of the whole House, I am sure—on

403
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
to those individuals?

404
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,980
>>Gloria De Piero (Ashfield) (Lab): Does the
Prime Minister believe that big companies

405
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,550
should put a worker on the board?

406
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:33,230
>>The Prime Minister: I believe that we should
see workers’ representation on boards. I

407
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:39,420
make no apology for the fact that this Government
are going to deliver on that. For all its

408
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,160
years in government, the Labour party did
nothing.
