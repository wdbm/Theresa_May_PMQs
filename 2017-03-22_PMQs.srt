1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,259
>> John Mann (Bassetlaw) (Lab):
If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,400
for Wednesday 22 March.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,320
>> The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May):
I would like to express my condolences to

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,280
the family and colleagues of the former Deputy
First Minister of Northern Ireland, Martin

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,680
McGuinness. Of course, we do not condone or
justify the path he took in the earlier part

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,801
of his life, and we should never forget that,
or the victims of terrorism. However, as my

7
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,650
noble Friend Lord Trimble set out yesterday,
he played an indispensable role in bringing

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,649
the republican movement away from violence
to peaceful and democratic means and to building

9
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,510
a better Northern Ireland.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,390
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,659
in this House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,790
>> John Mann:
The Prime Minister says that there is more

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:01:01,260
money for the national health service, more
nurses and more doctors, yet Bassetlaw breastcare

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,370
unit has been cut back and Bassetlaw children’s
ward has been closed overnight. Something,

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,760
clearly, does not add up. Therefore, the mothers
of the most seriously ill children, who use

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,360
the children’s ward the most frequently,
and I offer to work with the Prime Minister

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,470
to solve this problem. Is her door at No.
10 open to us?

18
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,640
>> The Prime Minister:
If we look at what has happened in the hon.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Gentleman’s area, we see that his NHS Bassetlaw
clinical commissioning group is receiving

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,020
a cash increase, and that the Doncaster and
Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,930
80 more doctors and nearly 30 more nurses.
He talks of listening to the voice of local

22
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,960
people in relation to health services in the
local area, but that is exactly what the sustainability

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,250
and transformation plans are about—hearing
from local people and local clinicians, and

24
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,770
putting together the health provisions that
ensure they meet local needs.

25
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:16,090
>> Lucy Allan (Telford) (Con):
Telford is a story of transformation and progress.

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,819
From the ironmasters of the first industrial
revolution through to a new revolution in

27
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,840
high-tech manufacturing at Telford’s T54
today, it has helped to build Britain. As

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,379
the Government deliver on the democratic will
of the British people and trigger article

29
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:39,909
50, will my right hon. Friend tell us how
Telford will prosper from Brexit and from

30
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,260
her plan for Britain?

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,760
>> The Prime Minister:
As I have said before, the referendum result

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,160
was not just about membership of the EU; it
was a vote to change the way that this country

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,370
works, and who it works for, forever, to make
Britain a country that works for everyone,

34
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,639
not just the privileged few. That is why the
plan for Britain is a plan to get the right

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,739
deal for Britain abroad, but also to build
a stronger, fairer Britain for ordinary working

36
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:12,400
families here at home, like those in Telford.
I am pleased that we have already provided

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,349
£17 million of funding to The Marches local
enterprise partnership to improve local infrastructure

38
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:23,299
in Telford. This Government are putting those
resources in, and our plan for Britain will

39
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,299
deliver that stronger, fairer economy and
a more united and more outward-looking country

40
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,349
than ever before.

41
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:39,129
>> Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab):
I start by echoing the words of the Prime

42
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,939
Minister concerning the death of Martin McGuinness,
the former Deputy First Minister of Northern

43
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,549
Ireland. He died this week, and our thoughts
go to his family, his wife Bernie and the

44
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:55,529
wider community. Martin played an immeasurable
role in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland,

45
00:03:55,529 --> 00:04:00,829
and it is that peace that we all want to see
endure for all time for all people in Northern

46
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:11,790
Ireland. This Government are cutting the schools
budget by 6.5% by 2020, and today we learn

47
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,310
that the proposed national funding formula
will leave 1,000 schools across England facing

48
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,020
additional cuts of a further 7% beyond 2020.
Can the Prime Minister explain to parents

49
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,650
why cutting capital gains tax, cutting inheritance
tax, cutting corporation tax and cutting the

50
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,620
bank levy are all more important than our
children’s future?

51
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,169
>> The Prime Minister:
This Government are committed to ensuring

52
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,440
that all our children get the education that
is right for them and that all our children

53
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,490
have a good school place. That is what the
Government’s plans for education will provide.

54
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,470
That is building on a fine record of the past
six and a half—nearly seven—years of Conservatives

55
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,360
in government, when we have seen 1.8 million
more children in good or outstanding schools.

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,639
We have protected the schools budget. The
national funding formula is under consultation,

57
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,069
and obviously there will be a number of views.
The consultation closes today and the Department

58
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,720
for Education will respond to it in due course.

59
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,319
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
The manifesto on which the Prime Minister

60
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,319
fought the last election promised:

61
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,990
“Under a future Conservative Government,
the amount of money following your child into

62
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,300
school will be protected.”

63
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:42,180
No wonder even the editor of the London Evening
Standard is up in arms about this. The cut

64
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,930
to school funding equates to the loss of two
teachers across all primary schools and six

65
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,419
teachers across all secondary schools. So
is the Prime Minister advocating larger class

66
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:01,330
sizes, a shorter school day, or unqualified
teachers? Which is it?

67
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,410
>> The Prime Minister:
We have, as I said, protected the schools

68
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:13,789
budgets. We now see more teachers in our schools
and more teachers with first-class degrees

69
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:20,590
in our schools. As I say, we see 1.8 million
more children in good or outstanding schools.

70
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,460
That is a result of this Government’s policies
of diversity in education: free schools, academies,

71
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,199
comprehensives, faith schools, university
schools, grammar schools. We believe in diversity

72
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,030
in education and choice for parents; the right
hon. Gentleman believes in a one-size-fits-all,

73
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,300
take-it-or-leave-it model.

74
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,280
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
The Prime Minister was clearly elected on

75
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,069
a pledge not to cut school funding, yet that
is exactly what is happening. Maybe she could

76
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,539
listen to headteachers in West Sussex who
say they believe that savings will come from

77
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:02,660
“staffing reductions, further increased
class sizes, withdrawal of counselling and

78
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,610
pastoral services, modified school hours,
reduction in books, IT and equipment.” I

79
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,210
have a heartfelt letter from a primary school
teacher by the name of Eileen. Eileen is one

80
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:23,280
of our many hard-working teachers who cares
for her kids, and she wrote to me to say:

81
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,330
“Teachers are purchasing items such as pens,
pencils, glue sticks and paper out of their

82
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,930
own pockets. Fundraising events have quadrupled,
as funds are so low that parents are having

83
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,009
to make donations to purchase books! This
is disgraceful.”

84
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,270
Does the Prime Minister agree with Eileen?

85
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,669
>> The Prime Minister:
We are seeing record levels of funding going

86
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,680
into our schools. We have protected the schools
budget; we have protected the pupil premium.

87
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,789
But what matters for parents is the quality
of education—

88
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:00,789
>> Hon. Members:
What about Eileen?

89
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:01,789
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. People should not keep yelling out,

90
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:11,650
“What about Eileen?” The Prime Minister
is giving her response to the Leader of the

91
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,469
Opposition, including the references to Eileen.

92
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:23,319
>> The Prime Minister:
What matters for all of us who are concerned

93
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,909
about education in this country is that we
ensure that the quality of education that

94
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:35,750
is provided for our children enables them
to get on in life and have a better future.

95
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,719
That is what this Government are about. It
is about ensuring that in this country you

96
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,791
get on on the basis of merit, not privilege;
it is about ensuring that every child—[Interruption]—every

97
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:56,720
child across this country has the opportunity
of a good school place. That is what we have

98
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
been delivering for the past seven years,
and it is what we will deliver into the future—and

99
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,399
every single policy that has delivered better
education for children has been opposed by

100
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,029
the right hon. Gentleman.

101
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,310
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Maybe the Prime Minister could have a word

102
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,380
with her friend the hon. Member for The Cotswolds
(Geoffrey Clifton-Brown), who said this week:

103
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,910
“Under this new formula, all my large primaries
and all of my secondaries will actually see

104
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,660
a cash cut in their budgets.”

105
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:36,180
In the Budget, the Government found no more
money for the schools budget, but they did

106
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:44,700
find £320 million for the Prime Minister’s
special grammar schools vanity project. There

107
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:52,260
is no money for Eileen’s school, but £320
million for divisive grammar schools. What

108
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,110
kind of priority is that?

109
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,370
>> The Prime Minister:
First of all, what we have done in relation

110
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:12,339
to the funding formula is to address an issue
that Labour ignored for all its time in government.

111
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,079
Across this House there has generally been,
for many years, an accepted view that the

112
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,149
current formula for school funding is not
fair. I was saying this—I was calling for

113
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,839
a better funding formula—more than 15 years
ago when I was the shadow Education Secretary.

114
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,300
We have put forward a proposal, and we are
consulting on it. The consultation closes

115
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,350
today, and we will respond to that consultation.
The right hon. Gentleman talks about the sort

116
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,709
of system we want in schools. Yes, we want
diversity, and we want different sorts of

117
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:53,980
schools. We have put money into new school
places. But I say to him that his shadow Home

118
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,290
Secretary sent her child to a private school;
his shadow Attorney General sent her child

119
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:09,047
to a private school; he sent his child to
a grammar school; and he went to a grammar

120
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:18,060
school himself. Typical Labour—take the
advantage and pull up the ladder behind you.

121
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,540
>> Hon. Members:
More!

122
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:35,990
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
I want a decent, fair opportunity for every

123
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:43,980
child in every school. I want a staircase
for all, not a ladder for the few. The Prime

124
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,110
Minister has not been very good at convincing
the former Secretary of State for Education,

125
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,700
the right hon. Member for Loughborough (Nicky
Morgan), who wrote last week:

126
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:01,790
“All the evidence is clear that grammar
schools damage social mobility.” What evidence

127
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,290
has the Prime Minister got that the former
Secretary of State is wrong in that?

128
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,040
>> The Prime Minister:
The evidence is that for the poorest children,

129
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,810
the attainment gap in a selective school is
virtually zero. That tells us the quality

130
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:28,180
of the education that they are getting. What
I want is a diverse education system where

131
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,750
there are genuine opportunities for all to
have the education that is right for them.

132
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,660
That is why in the Budget, as well as dealing
with the issue of new school places, we have

133
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,540
put extra money into technical education for
young people for whom technical education

134
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,570
is right. The right hon. Gentleman says that
he wants opportunities for all children, and

135
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,889
he says that he wants good school places for
all children. He should jolly well support

136
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,089
the policies that we are putting forward.

137
00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:01,060
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
It is not just the former Education Secretary;

138
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,660
the Chair of the Education Committee also
says that grammar schools

139
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,490
“do little to help social mobility” and
are an “unnecessary distraction”. The

140
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,570
Prime Minister and her Government are betraying
a generation of young people by cutting the

141
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:23,300
funding for every child. Children will have
fewer teachers, larger classes and fewer subjects

142
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,160
to choose from, and all the Prime Minister
can do is to focus on her grammar school vanity

143
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:36,680
project, which can only ever benefit a few
children. Is the Prime Minister content for

144
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:44,569
the generation in our schools today to see
their schools decline, their subject choices

145
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:50,240
diminish and their life chances be held back
by decisions of her Government?

146
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,839
>> The Prime Minister:
Protected school funding, more teachers in

147
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,930
our schools, more teachers with first-class
degrees in our schools, more children in good

148
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,500
or outstanding schools—it is not a vanity
project to want every child in this country

149
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,690
to have a good school place. That is how they
will get on in life, and that is what this

150
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:23,509
party will deliver. But this shows that there
is a 

151
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,360
difference between the right hon. Gentleman
and me. Earlier this week, he recorded a video

152
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,870
calling for unity. He called for Labour to
“think of our people first. Think of our

153
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,160
movement first. Think of the party first.”
That is the difference between him and me:

154
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,040
Labour puts the party first; we put the country
first.

155
00:14:47,040 --> 00:15:02,100
>> Charlie Elphicke (Dover) (Con):
For centuries, Prime Ministers have taken

156
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,730
a close personal interest in the effectiveness
of Dover and the channel ports as gateways

157
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,360
to and guardians of the kingdom, so may I
ask my right hon. Friend to take a close interest

158
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,000
in making sure that Kent ports are ready for
Brexit on day one, and not just in terms of

159
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,810
customs, but with the M20 lorry park on schedule,
and the A2 upgrade and the lower Thames crossing

160
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,139
being taken forward? Mr Speaker, will you
join me and the Prime Minister in wishing

161
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,339
Dame Vera Lynn a happy 100th birthday this
week and thanking her for her service to the

162
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,339
white cliffs and to the nation?

163
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,592
>> Mr Speaker:
I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman,

164
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,350
but I did do that a couple of days ago.

165
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,170
>> The Prime Minister:
I did not have that opportunity a couple of

166
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,610
days ago, so I am happy to join my hon. Friend
in wishing Dame Vera Lynn a very happy 100th

167
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,190
birthday this week. It is right that we recognise
the service that she gave to this country,

168
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,430
as many others did. My hon. Friend raises
the important issue of transport links in

169
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,541
Kent, which I have discussed with him and
other Kent MPs on a number of occasions. In

170
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,880
addition to the M20 lorry park, I assure him
that the Department for Transport is fully

171
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,740
committed to delivering a long-term solution
as quickly as possible. It is currently considering

172
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,639
the findings of the lower Thames crossing
consultation, and Highways England will be

173
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,769
doing more detailed work on the A2. The Home
Office will be looking very closely at what

174
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,360
measures need to be in place for Brexit for
those coming across the border into Dover.

175
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,269
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):
May I begin by extending condolences, as the

176
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:34,720
Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour
party have done, to the family, friends and

177
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,431
colleagues of the former Deputy First Minister
of Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness? We

178
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,690
pay tribute to his contribution towards peace,
while never forgetting the terrible human

179
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,810
price during the troubles.

180
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:56,080
Last year, the Prime Minister promised that
she would secure a UK-wide agreement between

181
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,940
the Governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and her Government, before triggering

182
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:09,839
article 50 on Brexit. Since then she has delayed,
she has blocked, she has been intransigent

183
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:18,760
and she has lectured—surprise, surprise;
she has no agreement. There is no agreement.

184
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,309
Will those be her negotiating tactics with
the European Union?

185
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:28,250
>> The Prime Minister:
Over the past few months, every effort has

186
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,850
been put in, at various ministerial and official
levels, to work with all the devolved Administrations

187
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,330
to identify their particular concerns and
interests, and to ensure that we are able

188
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,390
to take those into account throughout the
negotiating process. Discussions will continue

189
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:50,350
in the future. What we want to ensure is that
we get the best possible deal when we leave

190
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:57,000
the European Union for all the people of the
United Kingdom, including the people of Scotland,

191
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,499
because at heart we are one people.

192
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:06,049
>> Angus Robertson:
Viewers will note that the Prime Minister

193
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,370
totally glossed over the fact that she has
reached no agreement with the devolved Governments

194
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:18,559
of the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister
says that she wants article 50 negotiations

195
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:27,929
to lead to a deal and people to know the outcome
of that deal before it is approved. Will she

196
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:34,210
confirm that in the period for an agreement,
the House of Commons will have a choice, the

197
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,571
House of Lords will have a choice, the European
Parliament will have a choice and 27 member

198
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:48,049
states of the European Union will have a choice?
If it is right for all of them to have a choice

199
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,600
about Scotland’s future, why should the
people of Scotland not have a choice about

200
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,139
their own future?

201
00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:01,570
>> The Prime Minister:
This is not a question about whether the people

202
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:11,510
of Scotland should have a choice about the
future—[Hon. Members: “Yes, it is.”]

203
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:20,030
The people of Scotland exercised their right
to self-determination and voted in 2014 to

204
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:28,929
remain a part of the United Kingdom. The people
of the United Kingdom voted last year to leave

205
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:37,780
the European Union. We are respecting both
those votes; the right hon. Gentleman is respecting

206
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,230
neither of them.

207
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:47,840
>> Sir Julian Brazier (Canterbury) (Con):
With her strong commitment to defence, does

208
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,200
my right hon. Friend agree that we must stem
the outflow from our shrinking forces? I urge

209
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,500
her to reconsider the policy that she inherited
of encouraging service families to get on

210
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,029
to the housing ladder on the one hand, while
on the other hand increasingly focusing the

211
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:11,340
Army in areas where there is no affordable
housing, and then applying the new landlord

212
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,730
tax arrangements to buy for let.

213
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:20,740
>> The Prime Minister:
I recognise the passion with which my hon.

214
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:26,601
Friend always raises issues about the armed
forces. He raises an important point, but

215
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:31,700
I can assure him that we are fully committed
to our goal of an 82,000-strong Army by 2020.

216
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,950
On his specific point about service accommodation,
we want is to ensure that people have a greater

217
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,890
choice in where they live by using private
accommodation and meeting their aspirations

218
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,980
for home ownership. That is why we set up
the £200 million forces Help to Buy scheme

219
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,809
and continue to support subsidised housing
for service personnel—the pot of money will

220
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:58,450
not be cut. The Ministry of Defence is working
with the Treasury on the issues my hon. Friend

221
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,639
raises, and I am sure that they will keep
him updated.

222
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:05,230
>> Mr Angus Brendan MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan
an Iar) (SNP):

223
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,559
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland will be 95 years old in December.

224
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,539
In that UK, Scottish economic growth is a
quarter of that of independent Iceland and

225
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,580
a third of that of independent Ireland. Given
that the Prime Minister supports Irish independence

226
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,080
and the benefits that that has brought to
Ireland’s economy and population, why does

227
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,020
she oppose it for Scotland? Will she show
Scotland the respect that the EU showed the

228
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,330
UK in regard 
to a referendum?

229
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,179
>> The Prime Minister:
If the hon. Gentleman is looking at issues

230
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,660
around economic growth—he cited figures
on growth—he should pay attention to the

231
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:50,740
most important market for Scotland: the market
of the United Kingdom. That is why Scotland

232
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,700
should remain part of it.

233
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:00,559
>> Simon Hoare (North Dorset) (Con):
Last week, with cross-party support, my hon.

234
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,010
Friend the Member for Chippenham (Michelle
Donelan) and I set up the all-party group

235
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,320
on Lyme disease. This debilitating disease
is a growing problem across the country, including

236
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:18,071
in my constituency, yet awareness of it among
the public and GPs is incredibly low. Will

237
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:22,940
my right hon. Friend ensure that her Government
do all they can to raise the profile of the

238
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,780
disease and to resolve the problems surrounding
both diagnosis and treatment?

239
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,050
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises an important point,

240
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,441
and I commend him and my hon. Friend the Member
for Chippenham (Michelle Donelan) for the

241
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:38,850
attention that the House is now giving to
the issue. He is right that we need to raise

242
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,101
awareness, but we also need to ensure that
early diagnosis and treatment is available,

243
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:50,020
because that is the best way of limiting the
complications from this particular disease.

244
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,799
The Department of Health is already taking
steps. Clinical guidelines are being updated

245
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,179
and enhanced by the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence, and NHS England

246
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:01,590
has undertaken robust reviews on diagnosis,
testing and treatment. However, there is more

247
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,460
that we can do, so Public Health England is
holding regular medical training days and

248
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,980
conducting outreach across the medical community
to raise awareness and ensure that that early

249
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,620
diagnosis is in place.

250
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,190
>> Alex Cunningham (Stockton North) (Lab):
During yesterday’s Adjournment debate, the

251
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,910
Minister of State, Department of Health, the
hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne), said that

252
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,260
the issue in hand was above his pay grade.
On the basis that the Prime Minister has the

253
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,300
top pay grade, can she give us a clue about
when we will see the long-awaited and very

254
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,330
late tobacco control plan?

255
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,630
>> The Prime Minister:
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are

256
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,980
working on the tobacco control plan and that
one will be issued in due course.

257
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,750
>> John Stevenson (Carlisle) (Con):
A substantial number of Ministers took the

258
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:53,299
opportunity to visit Cumbria recently and
saw for themselves not only its beauty, but

259
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:58,020
its industrial strengths and potential. If
the Government’s industrial strategy is

260
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,350
to succeed, places such as Cumbria need to
be part of that success. Will the Prime Minister

261
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,450
ensure that Cumbria gets the infrastructure
investment that it requires to ensure that

262
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,100
it really does fulfil its potential?

263
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,679
>> The Prime Minister:
My ministerial colleagues and I were delighted

264
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:21,159
to be able to take the opportunity to visit
the beautiful county of Cumbria, and we are

265
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,892
even happier now that Cumbria has another
strong voice in the form of my hon. Friend

266
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:27,429
the Member for Copeland (Trudy Harrison),
a Conservative MP. My hon. Friend the Member

267
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:31,260
for Carlisle (John Stevenson) is right: Cumbria
and the north-west have huge industrial potential.

268
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,390
That is why we are getting on with delivering
our investment plans throughout the country,

269
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,940
including the north-west. Let me give the
House some figures: £556 million has been

270
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,289
allocated from the local growth fund to boost
local productivity; and the north is getting

271
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:49,049
£147 million to tackle congestion and improve
local transport. However, it is our plan for

272
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:54,970
Britain that will deliver that stronger, fairer
economy and those higher-paid, higher-skilled

273
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,250
jobs for people throughout the country.

274
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:03,000
>> Lilian Greenwood (Nottingham South) (Lab):
The Prime Minister is in denial. Today’s

275
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,730
report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies
confirms that schools are already facing“the

276
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:15,500
largest cut in school spending per pupil over
a 4 year period since at least the early 1980s”,

277
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,529
and that, as a result of her new national
formula, funding is being diverted from schools

278
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:30,450
with very high levels of deprivation. Every
single school in my constituency will lose

279
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:39,559
an average of £584 per pupil. Has the Prime
Minister failed at maths, or failed to read

280
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,899
her own manifesto?

281
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:47,040
>> The Prime Minister:
I responded to that point earlier, but let

282
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:56,010
me just reiterate what I said. Across the
House, for many years, there has been a general

283
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:03,659
acceptance that the current funding formula
for schools is unfair, and that is why this

284
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:11,260
Government are seeking a fairer formula. A
consultation exercise is taking place, and

285
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:18,120
the Department for Education will respond
to it in due course. We are grasping this

286
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,299
issue, whereas Labour did nothing for 13 years.

287
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:30,620
>> Sir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con):
Can my right hon. Friend confirm that, following

288
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:37,370
the forthcoming debate on the restoration
and renewal of Parliament, all Members, including

289
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:45,350
Ministers, will have a completely free vote
on what is a House matter? Does she understand

290
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,870
that many of us believe that in these times
of austerity, we should not be frontloading

291
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:59,039
billions of pounds of expenditure on ourselves
at the expense of schools and hospitals, but

292
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,909
should carry on the work and stay in what
is the iconic image of the nation?

293
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:10,850
>> The Prime Minister:
The Palace of Westminster is world-renowned.

294
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,770
It is a very important part of our national
heritage, and it belongs to the United Kingdom.

295
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,650
Of course, we also have a responsibility to
our constituents to preserve this place as

296
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:28,010
the home of our democracy. It will be for
Parliament to make the final decision, but

297
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,970
I assure my hon. Friend that, as this will
be a House matter, there will be a free vote.

298
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,760
>> Chris Evans (Islwyn) (Lab/Co-op):
Air and road pollution, brought about mainly

299
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,950
by diesel engines, causes 40,000 early deaths
in this country, while also causing severe

300
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,559
lung diseases such as bronchitis and asthma
among young people and children. Hafodyrynys

301
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,450
Road in Crumlin, which is in my constituency,
is the most polluted road in the United Kingdom

302
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,549
outside London. It is an absolute disgrace.
Most of the pollution is caused by heavy goods

303
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,419
vehicles such as lorries and trucks, which
travel along the road spewing out noxious

304
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:12,039
gases on to residents. Will the Prime Minister
commit herself to ensuring that hauliers will

305
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:18,950
start using newer diesel engines, cleaner
technology and cleaner energy, so that everyone,

306
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:24,940
including young people, can enjoy a better
quality of life, especially on Hafodyrynys

307
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Road?

308
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,710
>> The Prime Minister:
The hon. Gentleman speaks up well for his

309
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:36,019
constituents. We all recognise the problems
relating to air quality. The Government will

310
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:42,600
present further proposals, but some changes
have already taken place. We have invested

311
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,750
in green transport initiatives, and plans
to introduce clean zones around the country

312
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,440
will help to tackle the problem. In fact,
we have been at the forefront of action in

313
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,169
Europe in dealing with some aspects of it.
However, I accept that there is more to be

314
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,590
done, and, as I have said, we will present
further proposals in due course.

315
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,830
>> Huw Merriman (Bexhill and Battle) (Con):
The compensation paid by Network Rail to train

316
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:08,890
operators for delays far exceeds the amounts
that the passengers who experience the delays

317
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,909
are claiming because the ticket refund process
can be cumbersome. Will the Prime Minister

318
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:21,029
insist that train operators ring fence that
money, and spend it on automated smart ticketing

319
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:26,289
so that customers can tap on and tap off their
train, and receive money in their bank accounts

320
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,389
for the delays that they have been caused?

321
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:32,020
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises an important point,

322
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,950
which I know is a source of much frustration
to many rail passengers. I thank him and others

323
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,120
for the way in which they have spoken up on
behalf of passengers, especially those using

324
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,500
lines such as Thameslink and Southern. The
best way to ensure that the operators do not

325
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,220
profit from unclaimed compensation is for
passengers to claim the compensation that

326
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:01,029
they are entitled to. The Department for Transport
is looking at how we can ensure that we publicise

327
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:08,100
compensation schemes and make claims easier.
We are rolling out improved Delay Repay compensation

328
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,049
to allow passengers to claim after a delay
of just 15 minutes. The Department is continuing

329
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,679
to look at this issue, and I am sure it will
pick up the points that my hon. Friend has

330
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,679
raised.

331
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,120
>> Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire)
(SNP):

332
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,450
Last week the Electoral Commission imposed
on the Conservative party its largest ever

333
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,980
fine for breaking crucial election rules.
What did the Prime Minister, her Cabinet and

334
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,120
her aides know about any of this activity,
and who was responsible for designing and

335
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,650
signing off all this? Does she agree that
this was at best wilful negligence and at

336
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:47,019
worst pure electoral fraud?

337
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:50,261
>> The Prime Minister:
The hon. Gentleman asks me to respond to something

338
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:58,230
that is a party matter, but I can assure him
that the Conservative party did campaign in

339
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,970
2015 across the country for the return of
a Conservative Government, and we should be

340
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,610
clear that such campaigning would be part
of the party’s national return, not candidates’

341
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:17,570
local return, as the Electoral Commission
itself has said. The party accepted in April

342
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:23,590
2016 that it had made an administrative error
on its national spending. It brought that

343
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,520
to the attention of the Electoral Commission
in order to amend its national return. As

344
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:34,090
I have said, national electoral spending is
a question for the national party, not individual

345
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,230
Members. The Electoral Commission has looked
into these issues, as it has with issues for

346
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,679
the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party.
It has issued fines to all three parties,

347
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,130
and those fines will be paid.

348
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,639
>> Mr Ranil Jayawardena (North East Hampshire)
(Con):

349
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:53,120
The International Trade Committee has been
taking evidence about exports from chambers

350
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,279
of commerce this morning. Given the Prime
Minister’s commitment to a global Britain,

351
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,059
does she agree that we can maintain good relations
with our European friends as we leave the

352
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:08,610
European Union and also build on our long-standing
relationships with our Commonwealth friends

353
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:14,210
across the world to trade our way to greater
prosperity?

354
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,860
>> The Prime Minister:
One of the four pillars of our plan for Britain

355
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,433
is a global Britain—that more outward-looking
Britain. My hon. Friend is right that this

356
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:24,600
is not just a question of ensuring that we
get the right relationship with Europe when

357
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,770
we leave the EU. We do want to continue to
have a partnership—to be able to trade freely

358
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:39,480
across Europe, and for companies in EU member
states to trade with us—but we also want

359
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,520
to enhance and improve our arrangements for
trade with other parts of the world, including

360
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
members of the Commonwealth.

361
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,909
>> Siobhain McDonagh (Mitcham and Morden)
(Lab):

362
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:55,170
Last week, through no fault of her own, Amy
and her young daughter became homeless. After

363
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,679
months of looking for a flat, she finally
went to Merton Council, which told her that

364
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,720
it could only offer her temporary accommodation
in Birmingham, 140 miles away from her job,

365
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,940
her daughter’s school, and the friends and
family who make it possible for her to be

366
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,050
a working single mum. May I ask the Prime
Minister how it can be right that in one of

367
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:24,049
the richest cities in the world, where Russian
oligarchs and Chinese banks own scores of

368
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:33,870
properties and leave them empty, a London-born
working family like Amy’s have not a room

369
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,899
to live in?

370
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:40,200
>> The Prime Minister:
The issue of housing in the London Borough

371
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,169
of Merton is one that the hon. Lady and I
worked on many years ago when we were on the

372
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:50,720
borough’s housing committee together. I
recognise that she has raised a concern about

373
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,600
a particular constituent. Obviously I will
not comment on that individual case, but I

374
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,070
will say is that it is important that, overall,
the Government are dealing with the issue

375
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,750
of homelessness. We are ensuring that we are
building more homes and giving more support

376
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,410
to people to get into their own homes, but
this will take time as we make sure that those

377
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:19,299
properties are available and that we maintain
our record of providing housing support across

378
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,060
all types of housing in this country.

379
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,210
>> Nicky Morgan (Loughborough) (Con):
As the Prime Minister has already said, it

380
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,630
must be right that the same pupils with the
same characteristics should attract the same

381
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,790
amount of money. The unfairness in the system
was not challenged for 13 years under Labour.

382
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:41,430
Yes, there might need to be changes to the
current draft formula, but I hope that she

383
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,539
will commit to fulfilling our manifesto promise
to make school funding fairer. I think she

384
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,480
would agree that if the Labour Government
had carried on in office, their spending plans

385
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,310
would have led to what has happened in Greece
and Spain, where not just hundreds but tens

386
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,250
of thousands of teachers have had to be fired.

387
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:03,230
>> The Prime Minister:
My right hon. Friend is right. As I said earlier,

388
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,540
the issue of the funding formula for schools
was ducked for too long—it was certainly

389
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,120
ducked by the last Labour Government. We have
started to address it: we have been looking

390
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,020
at the formula, and we have brought forward
a proposal. We will look at the consultation

391
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,210
responses and respond in due course. She is
also absolutely right about the Labour party.

392
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,210
Its education policies would mean fewer opportunities
in schools, and its economic policy would

393
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,550
mean less funding for schools.

394
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,940
>> Jonathan Edwards (Carmarthen East and Dinefwr)
(PC):

395
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,630
Last week, the Prime Minister’s Government
confirmed that there had been no assessment

396
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:46,170
of the economic impact of a failure to strike
a trade deal with the EU before Brexit. Is

397
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,700
it not the case that, in triggering article
50 next week, she is the modern-day equivalent

398
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,221
of Lord Cardigan, the military commander responsible
for the charge of the Light Brigade? We all

399
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,880
know how that ended.

400
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,530
>> The Prime Minister:
In triggering article 50 next week, what I

401
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:05,090
am doing is responding to the wishes of the
British people.

402
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:11,910
Kevin Hollinrake (Thirsk and Malton) (Con):
Does the Prime Minister agree that we urgently

403
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,560
need to find a solution to the impact of the
national living wage on sleeping shifts in

404
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,300
the care sector? This, together with the policy
of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs of

405
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,190
insisting on the payment of six years’ back
pay, plus penalties, could have a devastating

406
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,400
impact on this vitally important sector.

407
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,030
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises an important point.

408
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,510
Through the national living wage, we are giving
Britain a pay rise and making sure that pay

409
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:47,450
is fair in all sectors, including social care.
On his specific point, we are looking at that

410
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,070
issue carefully, including in the context
of funding pressures on social care. We are

411
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,450
working to ensure that enforcement protects
low-paid workers in a fair and proportionate

412
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,531
manner. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
announced in the Budget, £2 billion of extra

413
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:06,090
money is going into the social care sector,
but the specific issue that my hon. Friend

414
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,000
raises is being carefully looked at by the
Treasury.

415
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,310
>> Rosie Cooper (West Lancashire) (Lab):
Despite austerity, shocking pay increases

416
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:21,421
were awarded to the board of the Liverpool
clinical commissioning group, with a lay deputy

417
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:30,940
chair now being paid more than £100,000 following
a 43% increase. Will the Prime Minister agree

418
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,400
to investigate the failures of governance
within the CCG and the lack of scrutiny within

419
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,380
the wider Liverpool health economy, and ensure
that no mergers take place while those matters

420
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,400
are being investigated?

421
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,710
>> The Prime Minister:
I understand that my right hon. Friend the

422
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,290
Health Secretary has asked NHS England to
investigate the remuneration of non-executive

423
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:57,090
directors at Liverpool CCG, and I am sure
that he will keep the hon. Lady updated. We

424
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,540
want to make the NHS even more efficient so
that every possible penny can be spent on

425
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,490
frontline patient care, and I am pleased to
say that we are seeing results. The financial

426
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:12,370
position has improved by £1.3 billion compared
with this time last year, with 44 fewer trusts

427
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,920
in deficit. As I say, NHS England is investigating
the issue that the hon. Lady has raised.

428
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,320
>> Mrs Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed)
(Con):

429
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,190
The Prime Minister will be aware that the
Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness is calling

430
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,410
us all to action to highlight and tackle loneliness.
In Northumberland, Forward Assist, a small

431
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,830
charity of which I am a patron, is taking
up this challenge, working with female military

432
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,360
veterans who are suffering from severe isolation
issues. Will the Prime Minister meet me and

433
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,370
some of those extraordinary women to learn
about how our Government can help to avoid

434
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,690
this outcome in the future?

435
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,250
>> The Prime Minister:
I commend the work that is being done by Forward

436
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,750
Assist in my hon. Friend’s constituency.
It sounds like a valuable project that is

437
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,750
doing important work. The Secretary of State
for Defence will be happy to meet her.

438
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,700
>> Jack Dromey (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):
The Schools Minister has been good enough

439
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,160
to agree to meet Erdington headteachers tomorrow.
The constituency is rich in talent, but it

440
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,800
is one of the poorest in the country. Some
96% of Birmingham’s schools will lose a

441
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,930
total of £20 million under the Government’s
fair funding formula, yet Surrey gains £17

442
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:23,530
million, Suffolk gains £10 million, and Windsor
and Maidenhead gains £300,000. How can that

443
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:29,240
possibly be fair?

444
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,060
>> The Prime Minister:
I note that the Schools Minister will be meeting

445
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:39,020
the hon. Gentleman and headteachers to discuss
the issue. The fair funding formula is about

446
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,400
trying to ensure that the unfair funding that
has existed up until now is actually dealt

447
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,370
with. There are some very, very stark differences.
There are schools in London, for example,

448
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,760
that get almost twice the funding of those
in other parts of the country. We need to

449
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,410
ensure that we address the unfairness in the
funding formula but, as I said earlier, there

450
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,260
is a consultation exercise and the Department
for Education will respond in due course.
