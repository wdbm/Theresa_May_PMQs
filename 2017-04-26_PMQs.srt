1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,410
>> Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con):
What recent assessment she has made of the

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:12,970
(a) performance of the economy and (b) adequacy
of provision of public services

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,239
in the west midlands; and if she will make
a statement.

4
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,500
>> The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May):
The economy in the west midlands is performing

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,910
well. Businesses are continuing to invest,
and since 2010 employment in the

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,640
west midlands has risen by 180,000. That is
because the Conservatives in government have

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,091
safeguarded the economy. As a

8
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:36,530
result—my hon. Friend asks about public
services—there are more doctors and more

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,120
nurses in his hospitals, because you can

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,070
only have strong public services when you
have the strong and stable leadership that

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,609
delivers a strong economy.

12
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:52,489
>> Michael Fabricant:
I think what this nation needs is a strong

13
00:00:52,489 --> 00:01:02,269
and stable Government. But is it not the case
that thanks to devolution, we

14
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:11,110
will not only have—I hope—strong and stable
government after the general election, but

15
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,860
strong and stable leadership in the

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,040
west midlands if the right choice is made
on 4 May?

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,190
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, because

18
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,720
on 4 May, people in the west midlands have
the opportunity to elect a

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,012
strong local leader who will oversee £8 billion
of investment. In Andy Street, I think that

20
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,920
they have absolutely the man

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,741
who has the local knowledge, the business
experience, and the commitment to the west

22
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:44,380
midlands to deliver for the whole

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,180
west midlands. Of course, on 8 June, people
in the west midlands will then have the opportunity

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,340
to elect the strong and

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,470
stable leadership of a Conservative Government.
Working together, strong Conservative leadership

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,250
in the west midlands and

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,500
strong Conservative leadership in government
will deliver for the west midlands.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,720
>> Richard Drax (South Dorset) (Con):
If she will list her official engagements

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
for Wednesday 26 April.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,289
>> The Prime Minister:
This morning I had meetings with ministerial

31
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,430
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties
in this House, I shall have

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,599
further such meetings later today.

33
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,219
>> Richard Drax:
In 2015, a group called the Socialist Campaign

34
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:27,930
for a Labour Victory incredulously drew up
a plan to disband MI5, disarm

35
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:35,430
the police and scrap our nuclear deterrent.
Would my right hon. Friend allow anyone who

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,469
endorsed such a plan to write her

37
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,629
manifesto or, indeed, serve in her Cabinet?

38
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:50,129
>> The Prime Minister:
My answer to that is a resounding no, I would

39
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,489
not. I commend my hon. Friend, who has a proud
record of defending our

40
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,700
country. He raises an important point because,
of course, the Leader of the Opposition has

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,379
chosen just such a person. The

42
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:10,120
plan to disband MI5, disarm our police and
scrap our nuclear deterrent was endorsed by

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,859
the right hon. Gentleman’s policy

44
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:19,650
chief and even by his shadow Chancellor. At
the weekend, we saw the right hon. Gentleman

45
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,069
again refusing to say that he

46
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:26,450
would strike against terrorism, refusing to
commit to our nuclear deterrent and refusing

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,860
to control our borders. Keeping

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,069
our country safe is the first duty of a Prime
Minister. The right hon. Gentleman is simply

49
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,699
not up to the job.

50
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:52,490
>> Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab):
This is the last Prime Minister’s Question

51
00:03:52,490 --> 00:04:00,219
Time of this Parliament, so I think it would
be appropriate if we all paid

52
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:06,230
tribute to those colleagues who have decided
to leave the House. I thank them for their

53
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,430
service to democracy in this

54
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,279
country. I also thank you, Mr Speaker, for
the way in which you have presided over this

55
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:19,769
House and sought to reach out to

56
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,620
the wider communities in this country.

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,000
When I became Leader of the Opposition 18
months ago—[Hon. Members: “More!”] If

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,710
Conservative Members wait a moment, I will

59
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,009
explain what I am about to say. When I became
Leader of the Opposition, I said that I wanted

60
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,770
people’s voices to be heard

61
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:55,650
in Parliament, so instead of just speaking
to hand-picked audiences who cannot ask questions,

62
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,099
I hope the Prime Minister

63
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:11,840
will not mind answering some questions from
the public today. I start with Christopher,

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,370
who wrote to me this week to say,

65
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:22,530
“In the last five years, my husband has
had only a 1% increase in his wages. The cost

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,510
of living has risen each year. We

67
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:32,910
now have at least 15% less buying power than
then.” Where is Christopher and his husband’s

68
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,050
share in the stronger economy?

69
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,750
>> The Prime Minister:
May I first join the right hon. Gentleman

70
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,900
in commending those colleagues who are leaving
the House for the service they

71
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,080
have shown to their constituents and to Parliament
over the years? I also say a huge thank you

72
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,181
to the staff of the House

73
00:05:56,181 --> 00:06:01,010
of Commons and of Parliament who support us
in the work that we do in this Chamber and

74
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,010
elsewhere.

75
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:08,510
By the way, I note that the right hon. Gentleman
did not take the opportunity to stand up and

76
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,759
say how he would actually

77
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:20,050
stand up for the defence of our country. Once
again, he missed that opportunity. I note

78
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,039
what he is saying about wages

79
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,540
increasing. I see today that he is talking
about paying for extra wage increases in the

80
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,330
national health service. First of

81
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:38,150
all, we should recognise that around half
of staff working in the national health service,

82
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,229
because of progression and

83
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:47,490
basic pay increases, will actually see, on
average, a pay increase of 4%.

84
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:55,289
What we know, and what I can say to Christopher,
is that he will have a choice at the next

85
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,740
election between the strong and

86
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,370
stable leadership of the Conservatives, which
will secure our economy for the future, and

87
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,860
a Labour party that would crash

88
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,650
our economy, which would mean less money for
public services, with ordinary working families

89
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,420
paying the price.

90
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,469
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Is not the truth that many people are being

91
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:22,490
held back by this Government, who have slashed
taxes for the rich, and held

92
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,870
back or cut the pay of dedicated public servants?

93
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:35,770
Andy, a parent, is concerned about how his
children are being held back. He asks why,

94
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,960
“despite the fact they have worked

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,960
consistently since leaving school, all three
of my children, who are now in their mid-20s,

96
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
cannot afford to move out of

97
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,260
the family home.” Is this not a crisis that
many people are facing all over the country?

98
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,460
Do we not need a housing

99
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,340
strategy that deals with it?

100
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,159
>> The Prime Minister:
First of all, let us look and see what happened

101
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:12,939
under a Labour Government on housing. Under
the last Labour Government,

102
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:21,780
house building starts fell by 45%. Under the
last Labour Government, house purchases in

103
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,669
England fell by 40%. The number of

104
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:33,839
social rented homes under a Labour Government
fell by 420,000. Under the Conservatives,

105
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,050
we have seen more than twice as

106
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:43,069
much council housing being built than under
the last Labour Government. That is the record

107
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,820
of a Conservative Government

108
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,439
delivering on housing and delivering for ordinary
working families.

109
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:55,320
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
The last Labour Government delivered a decent

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,440
homes standard for every council home in the
whole country, and it is

111
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,680
something we are proud of—we are very proud
indeed of that achievement. Under the Prime

112
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Minister’s Government, house

113
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:17,100
building has fallen to the lowest level since
the 1920s. More people homeless, more people

114
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,850
on waiting lists, more people

115
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:26,300
overcrowded, more people unable to pay the
rent—that is the record of the Tory Government.

116
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:35,240
Our children are being held back by Conservative
cuts. Laura, a young primary school teacher,

117
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,730
wrote to me this week to

118
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:44,380
say, “I’m seeing a decrease each year
in available cash to provide a quality education

119
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,880
to the children in my class and an

120
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,089
increase in reliance upon our parent teachers
association.” Is the Prime Minister still

121
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,399
denying the fact that funding for

122
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,540
each pupil is still being cut?

123
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,110
>> The Prime Minister:
What I would say to Laura is that we said

124
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,360
we would protect school budgets, and we have.
We have seen record levels of

125
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:17,230
funding going into schools in this country.
At the election on 8 June, people are going

126
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,350
to have a very clear choice. They

127
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,540
will have a choice between a Conservative
Government that have delivered 1.8 million

128
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,040
more good and outstanding school

129
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,889
places for children across this country, and
that believe in parents having choice with

130
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,149
a range of schools providing the

131
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,639
education that is right for every child and
a good school place for every child, and a

132
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,650
Labour party under the right hon.

133
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,100
Gentleman. He believes in “one size fits
all; take everybody down to the lowest common

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,300
denominator; take it or leave it”;

135
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,250
we believe in encouraging aspiration and helping
people to get on in their lives.

136
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,260
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Labour is not slashing school budgets. Labour

137
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,790
is not putting money into pet projects. We
want every child—every child—to

138
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,740
have a decent chance in a decent school. We
do not want an education system that relies

139
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,980
on begging letters from schools to

140
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,550
maintain employment and books in the classroom.

141
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:29,990
Many people feel that the system is rigged
against them. Maureen wrote to me this week—[Interruption.]

142
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,990
I say to

143
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,279
Conservative Members that if I was you, I
would listen to what Maureen has to say—I

144
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,311
really would—because she writes, with

145
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:47,839
a heavy heart, “We have been treated disgustingly.
Most of us women born in the 1950s will not

146
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,089
be receiving our pension

147
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:58,829
until we are 66, with no notification of this
drastic change. We have worked for 45 years

148
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,470
and have accrued more than

149
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:08,100
enough to be paid our pension. People want
what is rightfully theirs.” Maureen asks,

150
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,389
“What can be done to help the

151
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:11,460
WASPI women?”

152
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,160
>> The Prime Minister:
What I would say on the issue that Maureen

153
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,771
has raised is that the Government have taken
steps to help these women. Extra

154
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:28,120
funding has been made available and we have
ensured that there is a limit to the period

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,290
of time that is affected in

156
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,940
relation to these changes. If the right hon.
Gentleman wants to talk about pensions and

157
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,769
pensioners looking to the future,

158
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:42,860
then once again there will be a very clear
choice at this election—a clear choice between

159
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,240
a Labour party that in

160
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,500
government saw an increase to the basic state
pension of 75p in one year, and a Conservative

161
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,490
Government whose changes to

162
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:03,509
pensions mean that basic state pensioners
are £1,250 better off. But you only get that

163
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,040
with a strong economy, and what do

164
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,399
we know about Labour? Only yesterday, we saw
that we had finally emerged from Labour’s

165
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,980
economic crash. What we now see is

166
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,070
a Labour party that would do it again: crash
the economy, more debt, more waste, higher

167
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,510
taxes, fewer jobs. That does

168
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:32,760
nothing for ordinary working families or for
pensioners.

169
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,639
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Millions of WASPI women will have heard that

170
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,110
answer, as they will have heard the other
questions I have put that have not

171
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,930
been answered today. I simply say this: Labour
will guarantee the triple lock. Labour will

172
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,120
treat pensioners with respect

173
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,209
and we will not move the goalposts for people
looking forward to retirement.

174
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:03,540
Sybil, who witnessed the Labour founding of
the national health service, which made healthcare

175
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,660
available for the many, not

176
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,449
just the few, wrote to me this week, and she
says, “I am 88 and have had a wonderful

177
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:13,860
service from the national health

178
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:23,279
service, but nowadays I am scared at the thought
of going into hospital.” With more people

179
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,510
waiting more than four hours in

180
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,870
A&amp;E, more people waiting on trolleys in
corridors, and more delayed discharges thanks

181
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,279
to the Tory cuts, is not Sybil

182
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,880
right to be frightened about the future of
our NHS so long as this Government remain

183
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
in office?

184
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,329
>> The Prime Minister:
Let me just say to the right hon. Gentleman

185
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,980
that our national health service is now treating
more patients than ever

186
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:57,440
before. We are seeing more people having operations;
we are seeing more doctors, more nurses, more

187
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,769
midwives, more GPs, and

188
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,160
record levels of funding into our national
health service. But that is only possible

189
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,330
with a strong economy and only

190
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,620
possible with a strong and stable Government.
Of course, over the coming weeks we are all

191
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,660
going to be out there

192
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,829
campaigning across the country, as I will
be, on our record on the national health service.

193
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:29,040
I noted this week that the shadow Home Secretary
has been campaigning in her own personal way.

194
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
She has directed her

195
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:42,100
supporters—her followers—to a website
called “I Like Corbyn, But…” which asks:

196
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,980
“how will he pay for all this?”

197
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,269
“But”. It also says:

198
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,540
“I heard he wants to increase taxes”.

199
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
“But”.

200
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,009
“I’ve heard he’s a terrorist sympathiser”.

201
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,129
“But”.

202
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,329
“his attitudes about defence worry me”.

203
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:05,279
“But”. They are right to be worried. Unable
to defend our country; determined to raise

204
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,690
tax on ordinary workers; no plan to

205
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,290
manage our economy: even his own supporters
know he is not fit to run this country.

206
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:22,230
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
My question was about the national health

207
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:35,519
service and Sybil’s concerns. The NHS has
not got the money it needs; the Prime

208
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,430
Minister knows that. She knows that waiting
times and waiting lists are up; she knows

209
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,770
there is a crisis in almost every

210
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,360
A&amp;E department. Maybe she could go to
a hospital and allow the staff to ask her

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,319
a few questions.

212
00:16:54,319 --> 00:17:03,529
Strong leadership is about standing up for
the many, not the few, but the Prime Minister

213
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,049
and the Conservatives only look

214
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:19,220
after the richest, not the rest. They are
strong against the weak and weak against the

215
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,460
strong. Far from building a strong

216
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:30,980
economy, schools and our NHS are being cut,
people cannot afford homes, and millions cannot

217
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,539
make ends meet. That does not

218
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:46,500
add up to a stronger economy for anyone. The
election on 8 June is a choice between a Conservative

219
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,150
Government for the few

220
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,713
and a Labour Government who will stand up
for all of our people.

221
00:17:52,713 --> 00:18:02,880
>> The Prime Minister:
If the right hon. Gentleman wants to talk

222
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,030
about the NHS, perhaps he should talk about
Labour’s custodianship of the NHS in

223
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:18,580
Wales. There is somewhere that the NHS has
been cut, and that is in Wales under the Labour

224
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
party.

225
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:27,820
The right hon. Gentleman is right: in something
over six weeks we will be back at these Dispatch

226
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,809
Boxes. The only question

227
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,760
is: where will we be standing? Who will be
Prime Minister of this great country? He says

228
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,820
that the choice is clear, and it

229
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:48,510
is. Every vote for him is a vote for a chaotic
Brexit; every vote for me is a vote to strengthen

230
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,530
our hand in negotiating

231
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:58,701
the best deal for Britain. Every vote for
him is a vote to weaken our economy; every

232
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,941
vote for me is a vote for a strong

233
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:07,450
economy with the benefits felt by everyone
across the country. Every vote for him is

234
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,290
a vote for a coalition of chaos, a

235
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,410
weak leader propped up by the Liberal Democrats
and the Scottish nationalists; every vote

236
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,730
for me is a vote for strong and

237
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,650
stable leadership in the national interest,
building a stronger and more secure future

238
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,640
for this country.

239
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:41,960
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The exchanges between the Prime Minister

240
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,860
and the Leader of the Opposition have been
unprecedentedly comprehensive.

241
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,950
We wish to hear questions from Back Benchers.

242
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,820
>> Ben Howlett (Bath) (Con):
Thanks to this Conservative Government, the

243
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,200
west of England has received billions of pounds
of investment in transport

244
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,950
infrastructure. On frequent visits to Bath
by the Transport Secretary and the Prime Minister,

245
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
I have raised with them the

246
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,670
issues of congestion and air pollution, as
well as the need for a feasibility study on

247
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,540
the long overdue A36-46 link road

248
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,190
to the east of Bath. Does the Prime Minister
agree that the only way to secure that vital

249
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,909
infrastructure project is for

250
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:21,309
Bath residents to give me a renewed mandate
on 8 June?

251
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:26,360
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I know

252
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,960
that he has been campaigning tirelessly on
that issue on behalf of his

253
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,110
constituents. I understand that Highways England
is already considering a number of options

254
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,700
to divert traffic away from

255
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,600
Bath, as he suggests. Of course, it is this
Conservative Government who have increased

256
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,350
annual Government infrastructure

257
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,990
investment, but that is only possible with
a strong economy, which is only possible with

258
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,730
a strong and stable Conservative

259
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,039
leadership. A vote for any other party is
a vote for wrecking our economy and for a

260
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,850
coalition of chaos, which would do

261
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,740
nothing for my hon. Friend’s constituents,
for whom I hope he will continue to be able

262
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,249
to work tirelessly.

263
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:18,330
>> Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):
Will the Prime Minister give a clear and unambiguous

264
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,470
commitment to maintaining the triple lock
on the state pension?

265
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,159
>> The Prime Minister:
I have been very clear that under this Conservative

266
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,360
Government we have seen pensioners benefit
to the tune of £1,250 a

267
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:45,870
year, as a result of what we have done to
the basic state pension, and I am clear that

268
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,280
under a Conservative Government

269
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,070
pensions and incomes will continue to increase.

270
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:57,350
>> Angus Robertson:
I asked the Prime Minister a pretty simple

271
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:04,990
yes/no question and she failed to answer it,
so pensioners right across this

272
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:13,010
land are right to conclude that this Tory
Prime Minister plans to ditch the triple lock

273
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,120
on the state pension. Too many

274
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,410
women already face pensions inequality, and
the Tories will not even guarantee the pensions

275
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,740
triple lock. The only reason

276
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:33,210
they will not do so is that they want to cut
pensions. Is not the message to pensioners:

277
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,400
you cannot trust this Prime

278
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,860
Minister or the Tories with your pension?

279
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,790
>> The Prime Minister:
I say to everybody, as I have just said, that

280
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,720
the party that has, in government, improved
the lot of pensioners across

281
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:57,650
this country is the Conservative party. Under
a Conservative Government, pensioner incomes

282
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,970
would continue to increase. The

283
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,710
right hon. Gentleman talks about inequality
for women. The change in the structure of

284
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,430
the state pension introduced by this

285
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:13,750
Government is going to improve the lot of
female pensioners in the future; it is going

286
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,631
to be much better for them. One

287
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:21,691
thing that pensioners in Scotland will know,
as will other voters in Scotland, is that

288
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,070
if they believe in the Union, there

289
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,359
is only one way to vote, and that is Conservative.

290
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:33,799
>> Jason McCartney (Colne Valley) (Con):
My local clinical commissioning group is planning

291
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,980
to downgrade the A&amp;E at Huddersfield Royal
infirmary and move it to

292
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:45,470
Halifax. That has been dictated by a disastrous
private finance initiative deal. I have been

293
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,080
fighting these appalling

294
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,070
plans alongside the community campaign group
Hands Off HRI, which is led by Karl Deitch.

295
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,720
Will the Prime Minister join me

296
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,430
in praising the community campaigners, led
by Karl? Does she agree that patients should

297
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,539
not be suffering as a result of

298
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:10,179
the catastrophic PFI deals signed by the last
Labour Government, and will she ensure that

299
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:11,720
communities such as mine have

300
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,120
their voices listened to properly?

301
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,800
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend has raised this issue with

302
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,780
me previously, and I know that he has been
a tireless campaigner on it. He has

303
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:28,350
been a strong voice for his local constituency
and he has put his case persuasively to Ministers.

304
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,929
He is absolutely right:

305
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:39,899
Labour’s disastrous PFI deals are costing
the NHS more than £1 billion every year.

306
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,409
The choice at the election will be

307
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,159
clear. Do the people of Colne Valley want
his strong voice for their local A&amp;E,

308
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,210
and the ear of a strong Conservative

309
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,630
Government who are continuing to keep our
economy strong and investing in our national

310
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,360
health service, or do they want the

311
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,000
Leader of the Opposition and his coalition
of chaos—less money for our public services,

312
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,230
less money for our national health

313
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,899
service, fewer doctors, fewer nurses and worse
healthcare for our constituents?

314
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:11,970
>> Tom Blenkinsop (Middlesbrough South and
East Cleveland) (Lab):

315
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,320
My hon. Friends the Members for Redcar (Anna
Turley), for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin), for Newport

316
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,690
East (Jessica Morden), for

317
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,440
Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami), for Penistone
and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith), for Cardiff

318
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
South and Penarth (Stephen

319
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,230
Doughty) and for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) are
all proven champions for their local steel

320
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,020
communities. Does the Prime

321
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,530
Minister agree that their ongoing presence
in this place is vital for the future of our

322
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,019
British steel industry?

323
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:39,880
>> The Prime Minister:
I believe that the hon. Gentleman is standing

324
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,380
down at the election, and he has said that
that is due to his “significant

325
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:52,549
and irreconcilable differences” with the
leadership of his party. [Interruption.]

326
00:25:52,549 --> 00:26:07,081
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. I am trying to help Back Benchers to

327
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:11,080
be heard. Please help the Chair to help Back-Bench
Members.

328
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,429
>> The Prime Minister:
What is important for the steel industry in

329
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:20,000
this country is that this Government have
taken action to support it. I was

330
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,799
very pleased, when I visited Wales yesterday,
to be able to visit a company that works with

331
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,390
the steel industry galvanising

332
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:35,130
steel products. The company talked about the
greater amount of work that it is seeing and

333
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,580
the improvements in the steel

334
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,740
industry. This Conservative Government have
taken steps to support the steel industry

335
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,269
and will continue to do so.

336
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,700
>> Mary Robinson (Cheadle) (Con):
With the consultation on the Greater Manchester

337
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,340
spatial framework now closed, I would like
to thank the 3,600 Cheadle

338
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,990
residents who signed my petition. It called
for the green belt in Cheadle Hulme, Heald

339
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,900
Green and Woodford to be protected

340
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,770
and for much-needed homes to be built on brownfield
land instead. Does my right hon. Friend the

341
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,840
Prime Minister agree that

342
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,529
we must press for brownfield sites to be identified
and redeveloped, and that protections for

343
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,080
our precious green spaces

344
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,110
can only be maintained under a strong Conservative
Government?

345
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,080
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right on this

346
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,120
issue. I know that she has been a strong campaigner
and a strong champion for

347
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,200
her constituents in Cheadle. I can assure
her that we are very clear that the green

348
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,111
belt must be protected. What we have

349
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:35,809
set out in the White Paper is that boundaries
should be altered only when local authorities

350
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:37,850
have fully examined all other

351
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,450
reasonable options, such as making use of
brownfield sites, as she herself has suggested.

352
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,000
I know there was a great deal of

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,429
interest in the consultation on the Greater
Manchester spatial framework. I commend my

354
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,080
hon. Friend for the work she did to

355
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,820
gather the views of her constituents in Cheadle,
and I am sure that those views will be taken

356
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,210
into account as the response

357
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,210
is developed.

358
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,220
>> Rachael Maskell (York Central) (Lab/Co-op):
Over the past six months, it has been announced

359
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,110
that 2,000 jobs will be lost in York. Yesterday,
Nestlé announced 300 job

360
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,860
losses, 156 of them in my constituency, which
is devastating for workers, their families

361
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,640
and the community. Jobs, not

362
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,570
products, are being exported to the EU, and
as ever, York’s skilled jobs are being replaced

363
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,130
by low-wage, insecure work. In

364
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,490
the light of the special deal at Nissan in
Sunderland, will the Prime Minister meet me,

365
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,220
trade unions and the company to

366
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,000
strike a special deal to save these jobs and
avert the losses both now and in the future?

367
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,990
>> The Prime Minister:
First, the hon. Lady is right to raise this

368
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,512
issue of the announcement from Nestlé, which
arose, as she says, only

369
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:49,600
yesterday. We should be clear that Nestlé
has itself been clear that this is not a decision

370
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,720
that was affected by leaving

371
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,350
the European Union—it says it has made it
irrespective of that—but of course it is

372
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,610
a worrying time for the workers and

373
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:02,039
their families at Nestlé in both York and
Newcastle. I can assure her that we are already

374
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,519
in contact with the company to

375
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,299
understand its plans and the next steps. My
right hon. Friend the Business Secretary will

376
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:08,510
speak with senior Nestlé

377
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:13,370
representatives later today. The Department
for Work and Pensions of course stands ready

378
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,280
to put in place its rapid

379
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,810
response service to support any workers made
redundant by helping them back into employment

380
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,570
as quickly as possible, and

381
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,280
there are various ways in which Jobcentre
Plus can help. What is important is that we

382
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,920
ensure that the support is there,

383
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,110
and as I have said, the Business Secretary
will be speaking to Nestlé representatives

384
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,200
later today.

385
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:41,140
>> Byron Davies (Gower) (Con):
Record employment, the national living wage,

386
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,470
strong national defences and keeping our promises
on Europe—these are just

387
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,930
some of the achievements that we can be proud
that this Government have delivered. Does

388
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,230
my right hon. Friend agree that

389
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,220
only a vote for strong and stable Conservative
leadership in the national interest on 8 June

390
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,830
will continue to deliver on

391
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,279
the economy, defence and a deal with Europe,
and that the only way to enable businesses,

392
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,950
such as the Gower Brewery, and

393
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:07,080
residents in Gower to continue to thrive is
by re-electing a Conservative MP for the second

394
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
time?

395
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,169
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my hon. Friend for his question. He

396
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:22,669
has of course, since his fantastic, historic
election in Gower, been a really

397
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:28,909
powerful voice for his constituents, but also,
indeed, for the needs of Wales more generally.

398
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:29,950
I have already referred to

399
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,460
the fact that I was in Wales yesterday, and
had the opportunity to speak to people in

400
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,880
business and to meet voters and hear

401
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,581
their concerns, but my hon. Friend goes absolutely
to the heart of the matter when he says that

402
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:42,901
what is necessary is a

403
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:47,340
good Brexit deal. That is crucial for businesses,
it is crucial for jobs and it is only achievable

404
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,929
by a strong and stable

405
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,010
Government. Every vote for me and the Conservatives,
and for Conservative candidates at local level,

406
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,010
will strengthen our

407
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,010
hand in those negotiations.

408
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:01,100
>> Chris Stephens (Glasgow South West) (SNP):
Q7. Yesterday, the Scottish Tories’ shameful

409
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,460
defence of the rape clause failed because
their claim that third-party

410
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,480
reporting is in place is not true. Will the
Prime Minister confirm that no organisation

411
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,990
in Scotland has yet signed up to

412
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:16,350
help women fill in an eight-page “Why my
child is a product of rape” form, and with

413
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,570
DWP staff not trained either, is the

414
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,200
Prime Minister seriously going into this UK-wide
election with this unworkable and immoral

415
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
policy?

416
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,190
>> The Prime Minister:
This is an incredibly sensitive issue, and

417
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,440
that is why we have looked at it very carefully.
We consulted very carefully on

418
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,810
it, and we have put in place a series of sensitive
measures for when such cases arise. I think

419
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,810
it is important, however,

420
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:48,450
that we look at what lies behind this, because
underpinning this policy is a principle of

421
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,149
fairness, and we know that what

422
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:57,700
the SNP want to do is actually to scrap the
policy in its entirety. We believe that people

423
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,550
who are in work have to make

424
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,389
the same decisions as those people who are
out of work, so that people who are on benefits

425
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,000
should have to decide whether

426
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,679
they can afford more children, just as people
in work have to make such a decision.

427
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,270
>> Julian Sturdy (York Outer) (Con):
York is a fantastic place to live, work and

428
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,350
start a business, but transport infrastructure
is key if the city is to fulfil

429
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,980
its economic potential. Dualling the northern
ring road, a new railway station at Haxby

430
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,659
and upgrading the A64 will all

431
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:34,679
help to secure York’s future, so will the
Prime Minister continue to improve infrastructure,

432
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:35,900
secure a strong economy and

433
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,470
deliver for regions such as Yorkshire?

434
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,380
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises a very important point.

435
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,639
We have been able to invest in York, with
£1.6 million this year for

436
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,519
transport improvements, £2.2 million for
highways maintenance and £1.3 million to

437
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,330
support the sustainable i-Travel York

438
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,940
initiative, but we can invest in infrastructure
only if we have the strong and stable leadership

439
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,060
that secures a strong

440
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,880
economy. That is what the choice in June will
be. It is very clear: a strong economy, guaranteeing

441
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,950
investment in York and

442
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,190
across the country under the Conservatives,
or bankruptcy and chaos with Labour.

443
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,590
>> Stephen Timms (East Ham) (Lab):
As the Prime Minister knows, fixed odds betting

444
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,121
terminals cause immense harm in communities.
On taking office, she

445
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:25,720
authorised a review of maximum stakes and
all the evidence was collected by the end

446
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,600
of last year. Why do we still not have

447
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,659
a result? Will she today show some leadership
and reduce the maximum stake on these appalling

448
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:37,839
machines to £2?

449
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,540
>> The Prime Minister:
I recognise that a number of hon. Members

450
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:48,039
have raised concerns about this issue. We
did indeed have the consultation and

451
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,929
there will be a Government response to it.
Of course, that response—[Interruption.]

452
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,080
“Get on with it,” we are told. We are

453
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:03,260
now in a situation where these things will
be published after the purdah period and after

454
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,269
the general election, so the

455
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,970
right hon. Gentleman will have to wait for
that response. Obviously we recognise the

456
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,319
concern over this issue and we will

457
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,720
respond in due course.

458
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,949
>> Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con):
Should the Prime Minister find herself in

459
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,779
the vicinity of Milton Keynes over the next
few weeks, may I suggest a visit to

460
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,330
Milton Keynes university hospital, where she
will find rising clinical standards and investment

461
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,760
going in, with a new ward,

462
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,090
a new medical school and a new cancer treatment
centre?

463
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:37,880
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my hon. Friend. I think I will be

464
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,640
visiting communities around the whole country
over the next few weeks. I

465
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,709
congratulate the staff at Milton Keynes university
hospital on achieving that rating. As my hon.

466
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,710
Friend said, it was

467
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,470
backed up by considerable investment. As we
know, between 2015 and 2020 more than half

468
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,790
a trillion pounds is being spent on

469
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,290
the NHS in England. That is only possible
because we have safeguarded the economy over

470
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,540
the past seven years. As I have

471
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,850
said previously today, that will only be possible
in the future if we secure the strong and

472
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,680
stable leadership our country

473
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,530
needs. As I said, in Wales Labour has been
cutting the health budget.

474
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,400
>> Dr Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):
I invite the Prime Minister, instead of going

475
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,630
to Milton Keynes, to visit me in Southampton
and take a tour of

476
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:30,420
Southampton’s schools. If she does, she
will find that those schools are in despair

477
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,640
about the cut in pupil funding of 10%

478
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,380
in Southampton, which is £475 per pupil or
equivalent to the loss of almost 400 teaching

479
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,020
jobs across the city. She will

480
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,250
also find one school that is inviting parents
to clean the school toilets—

481
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,420
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The hon. Gentleman has got his point

482
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,290
across with considerable force.

483
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,900
>> The Prime Minister:
It is perfectly possible that I will find

484
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,720
myself in Southampton over the coming weeks.
As I have said before in this

485
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,180
House, there is general agreement that the
current funding formula is not fair. Labour

486
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,510
did nothing in 13 years of

487
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,410
government to address that. It is important
that we get it right and we will respond to

488
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,430
the consultation in due course.

489
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:21,070
What is good news for schools in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency is that 7,000 more

490
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,400
children are now in good or

491
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,850
outstanding schools in his constituency. Under
our proposed reforms, overall funding for

492
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,630
schools in his constituency would

493
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,630
rise.

494
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,990
>> Mr Speaker:
As he steps down after 44 years’ service

495
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,190
in the House, I call Sir Alan Haselhurst.

496
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:48,530
>> Sir Alan Haselhurst (Saffron Walden) (Con):
Will my right hon. Friend assure me that her

497
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:54,170
second Government will have high regard for
matters of great concern to the

498
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,970
Saffron Walden constituency, namely improved
railways with extra track capacity, in line

499
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,290
with the West Anglia and Great

500
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:07,840
Eastern taskforce reports; the spread of fast
broadband to rural communities; and an airspace

501
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,890
regime that prioritises

502
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,170
noise reduction?

503
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:17,411
>> The Prime Minister:
May I first pay tribute to my right hon. Friend

504
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:21,930
not just for his service to his constituents
over the years, but for his

505
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:29,250
service to the House when he took the Chair
as Deputy Speaker? He has been a stalwart

506
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,400
and a champion of the people of

507
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,350
Saffron Walden over the years—for 40 years,
as you said, Mr Speaker.

508
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,070
My right hon. Friend is right to raise issues
of infrastructure spending. We included £40

509
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,600
million for the east of England

510
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,410
in the Budget, but, as I think he implied
in his question, such spending is only possible

511
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,600
with the strong economy that

512
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,120
comes from a strong and stable Government,
and for Saffron Walden that will mean the

513
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,660
election of a Conservative Government

514
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,230
on 8 June.

515
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,740
>> Steven Paterson (Stirling) (SNP):
My constituent, Mr Buchanan, has suffered

516
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,490
several serious strokes and requires extensive
care. He was deemed to have

517
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,630
missed his appointment for an Atos assessment
when Atos arrived early for the appointment

518
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,130
and his carers had not yet

519
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,570
helped him to get up. As a result, his benefits
were stopped. Why is the Government’s welfare

520
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,120
regime punishing vulnerable

521
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,870
people like my constituent?

522
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:26,840
>> The Prime Minister:
We want to ensure that we have a system that

523
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,180
properly assesses people who apply for benefits.
As the hon. Gentleman has

524
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,490
said, and as other Members will know, there
have been issues relating to the way in which

525
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,730
the system has operated. The

526
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,010
Department for Work and Pensions has been
looking very carefully at it to ensure that

527
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,810
it makes proper assessments and

528
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,250
delivers the right results for people.

529
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,800
>> Mr Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden)
(Con):

530
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Does my right hon. Friend realise that I am
standing down after 34 years because of her?

531
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,170
I am standing down because I am

532
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:11,350
confident that the country will be safe after
the election under her strong and stable leadership.

533
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,240
Does she agree that

534
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,240
seizing the opportunities presented by regaining
control over our laws, our money, our borders

535
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,171
and our trade will be more

536
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:31,540
important than the terms of any exit deal
and that, if we are to secure a reasonable

537
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,740
deal, we must accept that no deal is

538
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:46,010
indeed better than a bad deal? To deny this
signals that no price is too high, no concession

539
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,400
too grovelling to accept—a

540
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,750
recipe for the worst possible deal.

541
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,770
I wish my right hon. Friend, all hon. Members
and this House I love Godspeed.

542
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:07,190
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my right hon. Friend for the tremendous

543
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,560
contribution that he has made throughout his
years as a Member of the

544
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:19,370
House, not only on behalf of his constituents
but during his time as a valued Minister in

545
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,330
a Conservative Government. He

546
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:28,100
has rightly highlighted the importance of
the decision that was made last year by the

547
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,070
people of the United Kingdom, and I

548
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,520
commend him for the role that he played in
the referendum campaign.

549
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,350
It is right that we get on with the job of
delivering Brexit and making a success of

550
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,410
it, which means having a strong hand

551
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:46,560
in negotiations. The only way to ensure that
that is the case—for the people of Hitchin

552
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,310
and Harpenden and for the whole

553
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,580
UK—is to ensure that a Conservative Government
is elected on 8 June.

554
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,750
>> Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson (Lagan Valley)
(DUP):

555
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,860
We do need a strong Prime Minister to lead
this nation, but we need the countries of

556
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,250
this nation to have a strong voice as

557
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:10,040
well. Does the Prime Minister agree that those
who abstain from taking their seats in the

558
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,630
House—those who are denying the

559
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:17,920
people of Northern Ireland the formation of
a Government—are denying their constituents

560
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,570
a say in the future of this

561
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,670
country? We, however, will not allow that
to happen.

562
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:26,150
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.

563
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,770
It is, of course, important for the constituents
who elect Members of

564
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:35,290
Parliament to feel that those Members of Parliament
are able to do their job—to bring their

565
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,451
concerns to the House and to

566
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,630
play a full part in the Chamber. The right
hon. Gentleman is also right to stress that

567
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,270
we want to ensure that every part

568
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,750
of the United Kingdom has a strong voice,
which is why it is so important that we continue

569
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,250
to work for the restoration of

570
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,960
the devolved Administration of Northern Ireland.

571
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,410
>> Sir Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar)
(Con):

572
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,960
The Prime Minister has shown considerable
leadership in adopting the International Holocaust

573
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Remembrance Alliance

574
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,700
definition of anti-Semitism. Does she believe
that it is the duty of all party leaders in

575
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
the house not just to pay lip

576
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:18,820
service to it, but to do something about it,
and does she share my disgust that a former

577
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,450
Member of this House, criticised

578
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:28,450
by the Home Affairs Committee for his anti-Semitic
utterances, is now the official candidate

579
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,430
in Bradford East—for the

580
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,950
Liberal Democrats?

581
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:49,130
>> The Prime Minister:
May I first pay tribute to my right hon. Friend—my

582
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:55,400
chum in this House—for all the service he
has given, and not just for

583
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,830
his service in this House: he had a considerable
record in local government before he came

584
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,160
into this House? He has also in

585
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,220
his time and the work he has done on anti-Semitism
performed a very important role: he has had

586
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,770
a relentless drive to stamp

587
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,181
out anti-Semitism and, indeed, intolerance
in all its forms in our communities, and he

588
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:18,520
should be proud of his record and

589
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:25,790
the work that I know he will continue to do
as a champion on this issue.

590
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,870
My right hon. Friend is right to highlight
Bradford—of course, he has a particular

591
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,380
knowledge of that city—and I think that

592
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,470
people will be rightly disappointed to see
the Liberal Democrats readopt a candidate

593
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,970
with a questionable record on anti-

594
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:48,210
Semitism. It is important that all parties
maintain the strongest possible censure of

595
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,120
all forms of intolerance and send

596
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,800
that message to our communities.

597
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:10,040
>> Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
In the nine months that the Prime Minister

598
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:17,450
has held office, she has closed the door on
desperate child refugees and

599
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:24,740
ignored the plight of those suffering under
the crisis in health and social care, and

600
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,100
she is responsible for the shameful

601
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:33,310
rape clause. Twenty years ago, she berated
the Conservative party for being the “nasty

602
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,510
party”, but her party has never

603
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,830
been nastier. The legacy of this Parliament—[Interruption.]

604
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,050
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. Whatever the strength of feeling, the

605
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,440
hon. Gentleman must be heard.

606
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,760
>> Tim Farron:
The legacy of this Parliament is the utter,

607
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,180
abject failure of Her Majesty’s official
Opposition to effectively hold her

608
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,530
Government account for any of this. Is it
not time that Britain had a strong, decent,

609
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,040
new Opposition?

610
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,193
>> The Prime Minister:
First, let me pick up the point the hon. Gentleman

611
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:14,660
made on child refugees. This Government have
a proud record on

612
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,310
supporting refugees from Syria. We have been
the second biggest bilateral donor to the

613
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,410
region, to support millions of

614
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:28,210
refugees and educate children, as I saw when
I visited Jordan recently, and of course we

615
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,720
have also supported some of the

616
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,620
most vulnerable refugees, including children,
by bringing them here to make a new life in

617
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,570
the United Kingdom. The hon.

618
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:42,730
Gentleman talks about a decent Opposition;
I find it difficult to hear those words coming

619
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,070
from his mouth when we have just

620
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,360
heard that his party has selected a candidate
with questionable views on anti-Semitism.

621
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:58,160
>> Sir Gerald Howarth (Aldershot) (Con):
It has been an immense privilege to serve

622
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,350
the people of Cannock and Burntwood and of
Aldershot for the past 34 years. I

623
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,090
arrived here in 1983, when one formidable
and determined female Conservative Prime Minister

624
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,940
was transforming the country’s

625
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,040
economic fortunes, and I depart as another
is determined to restore to this country the

626
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,260
status of a sovereign nation state

627
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,600
embracing the rest of the world. As I, too,
bid my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister

628
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,970
Godspeed for a resounding victory

629
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:34,810
on 8 June, may Aldershot make one final plea
in these troubled times: please will she ensure

630
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,680
that Her Majesty’s armed

631
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:43,190
forces are properly funded, manned, equipped
and housed to defend and protect the people

632
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,260
of this glorious sceptred isle,

633
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,620
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland?

634
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:58,093
>> The Prime Minister:
Once again, may I pay tribute to my hon. Friend

635
00:46:58,093 --> 00:47:06,150
for the work he has done in this House representing
two different

636
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:12,590
constituencies over 34 years? One of the underlying
themes of his time in this House has been

637
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,310
his passionate championing

638
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:21,960
of, and consideration for, our armed forces,
and I can assure him that on 8 June people

639
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,690
will have a very clear choice

640
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,430
between the Leader of the Opposition, who
refuses to defend our country, and a Conservative

641
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,540
Government who will continue

642
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,830
to support our armed forces.

643
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:42,110
>> Grahame M. Morris (Easington) (Lab):
May I ask the Prime Minister why she is running

644
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:48,070
scared of the televised leadership debates?
May I suggest that she hold a

645
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,790
televised debate in the Easington colliery
miners welfare centre, where she can see the

646
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,250
consequences of seven years of her

647
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:00,890
policies on housing, of the cuts to policing
and of 500 people at Walker’s losing their

648
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,890
jobs. Perhaps she could then

649
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,560
explain to the people there, if that is possible,
why she has any mandate to seek their support

650
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
for re-election.

651
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,040
>> The Prime Minister:
I have been in televised debates with the

652
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,740
Leader of the Opposition week in and week
out since I took over as Prime

653
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:21,950
Minister, and I will be taking the fine record
of this Conservative Government across all

654
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:22,950
parts of this country. The hon.

655
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,950
Gentleman talks about housing. Twice the number
of council houses were built under the Conservatives

656
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,950
as were built under

657
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:31,790
Labour. There has been record funding into
our national health service and our schools,

658
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,100
and pensioners on the basic state

659
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,740
pension are £1,250 a year better off. That
is the proud record of the Conservatives and

660
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,030
a record that we will continue

661
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,950
after 8 June.

662
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:55,290
>> Mike Wood (Dudley South) (Con):
It is good to be back—[Hon. Members: “Hear,

663
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:04,620
hear.”] To be honest, it is good to be anywhere.
Doctors and nurses at

664
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:12,010
Russells Hall hospital saved my life in January,
but each year in the UK, 44,000 people are

665
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,430
less lucky. Will my right hon.

666
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:21,950
Friend look at what measures we can take to
reduce deaths from sepsis, including awareness

667
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,100
raising, a national registry to

668
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:34,060
properly record the burden of sepsis and effective
commissioning levers to incentivise best practice?

669
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,030
The UK Sepsis Trust

670
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:40,960
estimates that such measures would save 50,000
lives over the next Parliament.

671
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,080
>> The Prime Minister:
It is fantastic to see my hon. Friend back

672
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,650
in his place. I hope that he will have noted
the welcome that he got from

673
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:57,440
across the House. He is absolutely right to
bring our focus on to the devastating condition

674
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,110
of sepsis. Every death from it

675
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,940
is a tragedy, but as we know, something like
10,000 deaths a year could be avoided through

676
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,860
prevention, early diagnosis and

677
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:11,370
treatment. So we need to get better at spotting
sepsis across the NHS, and the Department

678
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,950
of Health is already beginning

679
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:19,350
work on a new sepsis action plan. We are having
a new public awareness campaign and we expect

680
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,430
a NICE quality standard to

681
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:26,560
be published later this year. With the passion
that my hon. Friend now brings to this campaign,

682
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
I am sure that he will

683
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,460
continue to make his voice heard on this important
issue.

684
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,590
>> Mr George Howarth (Knowsley) (Lab):
Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Member

685
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,040
for Leigh (Andy Burnham)—who will be much
missed in this House—had a debate on

686
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,030
contaminated blood, in which he called for
an independent, Hillsborough-style panel to

687
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,500
get to the truth. The Prime

688
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:57,600
Minister has praised the independent panel
approach as a way to open up the door to justice,

689
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,310
so will she join Labour and

690
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:04,690
the Scottish National party in committing
to setting up such a process in her party’s

691
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,690
manifesto?

692
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:10,102
>> The Prime Minister:
Last July, we committed £125 million of extra

693
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:13,510
funding for those affected by the contaminated
blood tragedy of the ’70s and

694
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,040
’80s. That is more than any previous Government
have provided. We published some proposed

695
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,740
reforms last year, and we are

696
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,650
now consulting on a new measure to allow the
people affected to benefit from higher annual

697
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,350
payments, but I can reassure

698
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,630
everybody that everyone will receive, at a
minimum, what they receive now as a result

699
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,500
of the proposed changes. The

700
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,260
Department of Health will respond to the consultation
in due course.

701
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:40,920
>> Dame Angela Watkinson (Hornchurch and Upminster)
(Con):

702
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,290
It was a privilege to win back the seat of
Upminster in 2001 for the Conservatives. Will

703
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,730
my right hon. Friend tell the

704
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,910
House why the good people of Hornchurch and
Upminster should continue to vote Conservative

705
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,579
at the coming election?

706
00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:05,730
>> The Prime Minister:
First, I should like to pay tribute to my

707
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,410
hon. Friend for the contribution that she
has made, not just for her

708
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:16,120
constituents but in the time she served in
the Whips Office in this House, for example.

709
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,590
I am happy to tell the voters of

710
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:24,240
Hornchurch and Upminster that every vote for
me and the local Conservative candidate will

711
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,330
strengthen our hand in the

712
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:31,100
Brexit negotiations to get the best deal for
this country, every vote for me and the local

713
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,310
Conservative candidate will be

714
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:36,650
a vote for a stronger economy and every vote
for me and the local Conservative candidate

715
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,590
will be a vote for a strong and

716
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,671
stable leadership in the national interest,
compared with the coalition of chaos that

717
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:44,619
we would see under the Labour party.

718
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:50,610
>> Mr Douglas Carswell (Clacton) (UKIP):
What assurances can the Prime Minister give

719
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:55,420
to the 3.8 million people who voted UKIP at
the last election that if she is

720
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,670
Prime Minister after 8 June, the United Kingdom
will become a sovereign country again, living

721
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,160
under our own Parliament and

722
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,740
making our own laws?

723
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,780
>> The Prime Minister:
I will give an assurance to all those people

724
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,700
who voted for the United Kingdom to leave
the European Union—and to all

725
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:17,330
people across the country, regardless of how
they voted, who now want to see this Government

726
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,390
getting on with the job of

727
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:22,850
Brexit and making a success of it—that we
want to see control of our borders, control

728
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,260
of our laws and control of our

729
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,480
money, and that that is what we will deliver.

730
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,780
>> Mr Speaker:
In wishing the right hon. Gentleman all the

731
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:35,520
best for the future, I call Sir Simon Burns.

732
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:49,680
>> Sir Simon Burns (Chelmsford) (Con):
Mr Speaker, may I thank you for that? May

733
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:56,310
I tell my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
that, for 30 years, I have had

734
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:03,190
the privilege and the honour to represent
the great people of Chelmsford? May I tell

735
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,680
her that the great people of

736
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:12,150
Chelmsford are perspicacious and that they
have always wanted a Government who provide

737
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,890
strong defences, a strong economy

738
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:22,040
and strong leadership? May I also tell her
that it is the Conservative party under her

739
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,780
strong leadership that will deliver

740
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:32,109
for this country for the next five years?

741
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:38,610
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my right hon. Friend for the significant

742
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:44,800
contribution that he has made for his constituents
in Chelmsford, in this

743
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:51,940
House and in government over his period of
time here. He is absolutely right to say that

744
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,290
his constituents will be looking

745
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,400
for strong defences, a strong economy and
the strong leadership that will build a more

746
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,090
secure future for this country, and

747
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,860
it is only a Conservative Government that
can provide that.

748
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:07,230
>> Alex Salmond (Gordon) (SNP):
In this Brexit world, the Prime Minister is

749
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,420
desperate to obtain trade deals with anybody
or nobody, so the International

750
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,890
Trade Secretary went to the Philippines this
month, where he appeared with the President

751
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,221
and said that he wanted a strong

752
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:24,000
relationship based on “shared values”.
Can the Prime Minister identify for the House

753
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,370
what shared values she has in common

754
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,370
with President Rodrigo Duterte?

755
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,922
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that,

756
00:55:31,922 --> 00:55:35,510
as we leave the European Union, we want to
ensure that we are a truly

757
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,530
global Britain and that we have trade deals
around the rest of the world. The reason that

758
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,970
we want those trade deals—as

759
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:46,540
well as the strong, secure, deep and special
partnership with the European Union on trade—is

760
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,540
so that we can ensure

761
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:55,170
prosperity across the whole of this country
and jobs for ordinary working families.
