1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,810
>>Chris Law (Dundee West) (SNP): If she will
list her official engagements for Wednesday

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
11 January.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,610
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,439
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

5
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:18,740
later today.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,249
>>Chris Law: A very happy new year to you,
Mr Speaker, and I would like to extend that

7
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:26,240
to everyone in this House.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,999
It has been more than six months since the
European referendum. Embarrassingly for the

9
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:36,780
Prime Minister, the Scottish Government are
the only Administration on these islands to

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:49,750
have published a plan on what to do next.
Has she read it yet? When will she be publishing

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,920
her own plan?

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,700
>>The Prime Minister: I join the hon. Gentleman
in wishing everybody in the House, not only

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,079
Members, but all the staff of the House, a
very happy new year.

14
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,140
As I said to the Liaison Committee when I
appeared in front of it before Christmas,

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,120
I will, in a matter of weeks, be setting out
some more details of our proposals on this

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,010
issue. I would like just to remind him, when
he talks about the Scottish Government’s

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,210
plan, that of course it is his party, the
Scottish nationalist party, that wants to

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,940
leave the United Kingdom and therefore leave
the European Union.

19
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:32,140
>>Mark Menzies (Fylde) (Con): Westinghouse’s
Springfields site in my constituency employs

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,880
more than 1,200 people in highly skilled jobs
manufacturing nuclear fuel, which generates

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,610
15% of the UK’s electricity. Does my right
hon. Friend agree that the nuclear industry

22
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,380
is of crucial importance to the north-west
economy? Will she continue to support the

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,390
construction of a new generation of nuclear
power stations to guarantee jobs in the region?

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,410
>>The Prime Minister: I certainly agree with
my hon. Friend that new nuclear does have

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,910
a crucial role to play in securing our future
energy needs, especially as we are looking

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,920
to move to a low-carbon society. The industrial
strategy that the Government will be setting

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,810
out will have a strong emphasis on the role
of regions in supporting economic growth and

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,120
ensuring that the economy works for everyone.
Like him, I very much welcome the proposals

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,200
from NuGen and Toshiba to develop a new nuclear
power station at Moorside in Cumbria. The

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy continues to work closely with NuGen

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,140
and other developers as they bring their proposals
forward.

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,350
>>Mr Speaker: I call Jeremy Corbyn.

33
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,350
[Hon. Members: “Hear, hear!”]

34
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,041
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): Thank
you, Mr Speaker. It is nice to get such a

35
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:47,700
warm welcome, and may I wish all Members,
as well as all members of staff in the House,

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
a happy new year?

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,180
I hope the whole House will join me—I am
sure it will—in paying tribute to 22- year-old

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,950
Lance Corporal Scott Hetherington, who died
in a “non-combat” incident in Iraq last

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,040
Monday. I am sure the whole House will also
join in sending its heartfelt condolences

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,810
to the family and friends of seven-year-old
Katie Rough, who tragically died in York earlier

41
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,270
this week. I think it is right that we send
condolences to her family.

42
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:22,819
Last week, 485 people in England spent more
than 12 hours on trolleys in hospital corridors.

43
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,380
The Red Cross described this as a “humanitarian
crisis”. I called on the Prime Minister

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,400
to come to Parliament on Monday, but she did
not—she sent the Health Secretary. But does

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,390
she agree with him that the best way to solve
the crisis of the four-hour wait is to fiddle

46
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,090
the figures so that people are not seen to
be waiting so long on trolleys in NHS hospitals?

47
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,000
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I join the
right hon. Gentleman in sending our condolences

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,860
to the family of Lance Corporal Hetherington,
who, as he said, died in a non-combat incident

49
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,980
in Iraq? From everything I have seen and read
about Lance Corporal Hetherington, he was

50
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,410
a very fine young man. He delighted in being
in the armed forces, and we are proud that

51
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,180
such a fine young man was in our armed forces.
I also join the right hon. Gentleman in expressing

52
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,130
condolences to the family and friends of little
Katie, who died so tragically.

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,409
The right hon. Gentleman talks about the pressures
on the NHS, and we acknowledge that there

54
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:29,749
are pressures on the National Health Service.
There are always extra pressures on the NHS

55
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:33,819
during the winter but, of course, we have
at the moment those added pressures of the

56
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:40,009
ageing population and the growing complex
needs of the population. He also refers to

57
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:45,150
the British Red Cross’s term, “humanitarian
crisis.” I have to say to him that I think

58
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,650
we have all seen humanitarian crises around
the world, and to use that description of

59
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:01,460
a National Health Service that last year saw
2.5 million more people treated in accident

60
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,620
and emergency than six years ago was irresponsible
and overblown.

61
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:18,080
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Some 1.8 million people had
to wait longer than four hours in A&amp;E

62
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,639
departments last year. The Prime Minister
might not like what the Red Cross said, but

63
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,460
on the same day the British Medical Association
said that

64
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,129
“conditions in hospitals across the country
are reaching a dangerous level.”

65
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,440
The Royal College of Nursing has said that
NHS conditions are the worst ever. The Royal

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,030
College of Physicians has told the Prime Minister
that the NHS is

67
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,499
“under-funded, under-doctored and overstretched.”

68
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,699
If she will not listen to the Red Cross, who
will she listen to?

69
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,249
>>The Prime Minister: I have said to the right
hon. Gentleman that I of course acknowledge

70
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,860
that there are pressures on the National Health
Service. The Government have put extra funding

71
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,990
into the National Health Service. The fact
is that we are seeing more people being treated

72
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,111
in our NHS: 2,500 more people are treated
within four hours every day in the National

73
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:08,830
Health Service because of the Government putting
in extra funding and because of the hard work

74
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,479
of medical professionals in our National Health
Service. It is not just a question of targets

75
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,114
for the health service, although we continue
to have a commitment to the four-hour target,

76
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:25,930
as the Health Secretary has made clear. It
is a question of making sure that people are

77
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,610
provided with the appropriate care for them,
and the best possible care for them in their

78
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,610
circumstances.

79
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,050
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The right hon. Lady seems
to be in some degree of denial about this.

80
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,500
She will not listen to professional organisations
that have spent their whole lifetimes doing

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,860
their best for the NHS, but will she listen
to Sian, who works for the NHS? She has a

82
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,110
22-month old nephew. He went into hospital,
but there was no bed. He was treated on two

83
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,139
plastic chairs pushed together with a blanket.
Sian says that

84
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,279
“one of the nurses told my sister that it’s
always like this nowadays”.

85
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,590
She says to us all:

86
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,629
“Surely we should strive to do better than
this.”

87
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:16,349
Do the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary
think that is an acceptable way to treat a

88
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,009
22-month-old child in need of help?

89
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:28,629
>>The Prime Minister: I accept that there
have been a small number of incidents in which

90
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:37,539
unacceptable practices have taken place. We
do not want those things to happen, but what

91
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,720
matters is how you deal with them, which is
why it is so important that the NHS looks

92
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,380
into the issues when unacceptable incidents
have taken place and learns lessons from them.

93
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,809
I come back to the point that I was making
earlier: the right hon. Gentleman talks about

94
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:57,839
the hard-working healthcare professionals,
like Sian, in the National Health Service,

95
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:04,339
and indeed we should be grateful for all those
who are working in the NHS, but on the Tuesday

96
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:11,059
after Christmas we saw the busiest day ever
in the National Health Service, and over the

97
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:18,039
few weeks around Christmas we saw the day
on which more people were treated in accident

98
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,480
and emergency within four hours than ever
before. That is the reality of our National

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,669
Health Service.

100
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:33,709
>>Jeremy Corbyn: We all thank NHS staff and
we all praise NHS staff, but the Prime Minister’s

101
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:38,619
Government are proposing, through sustainability
and transformation, to cut one third of the

102
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,810
beds in all of our hospitals in the very near
future. On Monday, she spoke about mental

103
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,639
health and doing more to help people, particularly
young people, with those conditions, which

104
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:55,430
I welcome, except that last night the BBC
revealed that, over five years, there had

105
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:02,170
been an 89% increase in young people with
mental health issues having to go to A&E

106
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:08,000
departments. Does she not agree that the £1.25
billion committed to child and adolescent

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,880
mental health in 2015 should have been ring-fenced
rather than used as a resource to be raided

108
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,079
to plug other holes in other budgets in the
NHS?

109
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,620
>>The Prime Minister: If we look at what is
happening with mental health treatment in

110
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,700
the national health service, we see 1,400
more people every day accessing mental health

111
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,899
services. When I spoke about this issue on
Monday, I said that there is of course more

112
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,850
for us to do—this is not a problem that
will be resolved overnight. I have set out

113
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,240
ways in which we will see an improvement in
the services in relation to mental health,

114
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,050
but it is about the appropriate care for the
individual. As I mentioned earlier, that is

115
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:59,709
not just about accident and emergency. When
I was in Aldershot on Monday, I spoke to service

116
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:05,810
users with mental health problems who said
that they did not want to go to A&E. The provision

117
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,399
of alternative services has meant that the
A&E locally has seen its numbers stabilising

118
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,009
rather than going up. It is about the appropriate
care for the individual. We want to see that

119
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,839
good practice spread across the whole country.

120
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,519
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Nobody wants people with
mental health conditions to go to A&E departments—the

121
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,959
A&E departments do not want them to go there.
Under this Government, there are 6,000 fewer

122
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,670
nurses and 400 fewer doctors working in mental
health. It is obvious that these people will

123
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:46,240
go somewhere to try to get help when they
are in a desperate situation. Our NHS is under

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,870
huge pressure. Much of that is caused by cuts
to social care, which the Royal College of

125
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,870
Physicians says

126
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,870
“are pushing more people into our hospitals
and trapping them there for longer.”

127
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,792
Will the Prime Minister do what my hon. Friend
the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)

128
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:11,459
has called for and bring forward now the extra
£700 million allocated in 2019 and put it

129
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,690
into social care so that we do not have this
problem of people staying too long in hospital

130
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,839
when they should be cared for by a social
care system?

131
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,790
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
asked me those questions in the last PMQs

132
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:32,790
before Christmas. [Interruption.] He may find
it difficult to believe that somebody will

133
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:45,830
say the same thing that they said a few weeks
ago, but we have put extra money into social

134
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,389
care. In the medium term, we are ensuring
that best practice is spread across the country.

135
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,699
He talks about delayed discharges. Some local
authorities, which work with their health

136
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:05,730
service locally, have virtually no delayed
discharges. Some 50%—half of the delayed

137
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,231
discharges—are in only 24 local authority
areas. What does that tell us? It tells us

138
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:18,290
that it is about not just funding, but best
practice. If he comes back to me and talks

139
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,410
to me about funding again, he should think
on this: we can only fund social care and

140
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,230
the NHS if we have a strong economy, and we
will only have that with the Conservatives.

141
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:33,620
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I am sorry to have to bring
the Prime Minister back to the subject of

142
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,079
social care, which I raised before Christmas.
The reason I did so, and will continue to

143
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:46,160
do so, is that she has not addressed the problem.
The Government have cut £4.6 billion from

144
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,339
the social care budget. The King’s Fund
says that there is a social care funding gap

145
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,920
of almost £2 billion this year.

146
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said
that she wanted to create a “shared society”.

147
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,949
Well, we certainly have that: more people
sharing hospital corridors on trolleys; more

148
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:12,670
people sharing waiting areas in A&amp;E departments;
and more people sharing in the anxiety created

149
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:20,680
by this Government. Our NHS is in crisis,
but the Prime Minister is in denial. May I

150
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,449
suggest to her that, on the economic question,
she should cancel the corporate tax cuts,

151
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:33,519
and spend the money where it is needed—on
people in desperate need in social care and

152
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,660
in our hospitals?

153
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,480
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
talks about a crisis. I suggest he listens

154
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,910
to the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline
Flint), a former Labour Health Minister, who

155
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,480
said that, with Labour,

156
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,210
“It’s always about ‘crisis...the NHS
is on its knees’… We’ve got to be a

157
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,120
bit more grown up about this.”

158
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,259
And he talks to me about restoring the cuts
in corporation tax. The Labour party has already

159
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:09,949
spent that money eight times. The last thing
the NHS needs is a cheque from Labour that

160
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,449
bounces. The only way that we can ensure that
we have funding for the national health service

161
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:18,980
is with a strong economy. Yesterday, the right
hon. Gentleman proved that he is not only

162
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,041
incompetent, but that he would destroy our
economy, and that would devastate our national

163
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,810
health service.

164
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:40,279
>>Mrs Maria Miller (Basingstoke) (Con): Cyber-bullying,
sexting and revenge pornography are part of

165
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,980
British teenage life today; so is a rapid
increase in mental health problems among our

166
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,959
teenagers. How is the Prime Minister helping
to tackle the pressures that teenagers face

167
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,020
in Britain today?

168
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,970
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
raises an important point. One of the things

169
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,589
I spoke about, when I spoke about mental health
on Monday, was trying to ensure that we can

170
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,410
provide some better training for staff and
teachers in schools to identify the early

171
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:15,129
stages of mental health problems for young
people, so that those problems can be addressed.

172
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:20,180
Something like half of all mental health problems
start before the age of 14, so this is a real

173
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,290
issue that we need to address. We are going
to look at how we can provide that training.

174
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,069
We will also review the mental health services
provided for young people to ensure that we

175
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:38,139
can identify what is working and make sure
that good practice is spread across the country.

176
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:44,459
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): May I begin
with a tribute to Father George Thompson,

177
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:50,269
who died shortly before Christmas? He led
a remarkable life as a teacher, as a priest

178
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:53,910
and as the Scottish National party Member
of Parliament for Galloway. We extend our

179
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,759
sympathies to his family.

180
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,380
All of us in this House and across these islands
care about the peace process and about the

181
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,620
democratic institutions in Northern Ireland,
so may I wish the Prime Minister well and

182
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,120
the Taoiseach, the Northern Ireland Secretary
and the political parties all the best in

183
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,709
trying to resolve the serious political difficulties
there? Will the Prime Minister tell us what

184
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,820
the consequences will be if no agreement can
be found?

185
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,209
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I join the
right hon. Gentleman in offering condolences

186
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,130
to the family and friends of the Rev. George
Thompson, who, as he says, was the MP for

187
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,430
Galloway between 1974 and 1979 and, I believe,
was the first former MP in modern times to

188
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,460
be ordained a Roman Catholic priest.

189
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,370
On the issue that the right hon. Gentleman
raises about the political situation in Northern

190
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,910
Ireland, we are obviously treating this with
the utmost seriousness. As he will know, my

191
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,019
right hon. Friend the Northern Ireland Secretary
made a statement in the House earlier this

192
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:55,500
week on this issue. He has spoken to the First
Minister and the former Deputy First Minister,

193
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,360
and he is urging all parties to work together
to find a way forward. I have also spoken

194
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,770
to the Taoiseach about this issue, so we are
putting every effort into this. The legislation

195
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,960
says that if, within seven days, we do not
have a nomination for a Deputy First Minister,

196
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,330
the matter would go to an election.

197
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,639
>>Angus Robertson: The Prime Minister has
indicated that she wants to take the views

198
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,650
of the elected representatives and the devolved
institutions on Brexit seriously. So it stands

199
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,330
to reason then that if there is no Northern
Ireland Assembly and no Northern Ireland Executive

200
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:41,640
for much of the time before the March timetable
that she has set for invoking article 50,

201
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,600
she will be unable to consult properly, to
discuss fully and to find agreement on the

202
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:55,020
complex issues during this period. In these
circumstances, will the Prime Minister postpone

203
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:07,370
invoking article 50—[Interruption]—or
will she just plough on regardless?

204
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:14,310
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
says, we want to ensure that we do hear the

205
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:22,010
views from all parts of the United Kingdom.
That is why we have established the JMC European

206
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,270
committee specifically to take views, and
the JMC plenary, which is also obviously meeting

207
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,650
more frequently than previously. I am clear
that, first of all, we want to try to ensure

208
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,760
that, within this period of seven days, we
can find a resolution to the political situation

209
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,390
in Northern Ireland, so that we can to see
the Assembly Government continuing. But I

210
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,620
am also clear that, in the discussions that
we have, it will be possible—it is still

211
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:53,160
the case that Ministers are in place and that,
obviously, there are executives in place—that

212
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,190
we are still able to take the views of the
Northern Ireland people.

213
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,640
>>Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con): What
recent assessment she has made of the (a)

214
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,310
performance of the economy and (b) adequacy
of provision of public services in Staffordshire;

215
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,010
and if she will make a statement.

216
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:13,940
>>The Prime Minister: The fundamentals of
the UK’s economy are strong, including in

217
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,290
Staffordshire and the west midlands. Employment
in Staffordshire has risen by over 20,000

218
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,880
since 2010. We have protected schools and
police budgets. We see more doctors and more

219
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,171
nurses in the Burton hospitals trust. Of course,
we are going further than this in the west

220
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:34,430
midlands by giving new powers to the west
midlands with the devolution deal and with

221
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,170
the election of a directly elected Mayor.
I have to say that I think Andy Street, with

222
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,550
his business and local experience, would be
a very good Mayor for the west midlands.

223
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,990
>>Michael Fabricant: I thank my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister for that answer.

224
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:55,490
Unemployment in my constituency—my beautiful
Lichfield constituency—is around 0.7%, and

225
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:04,370
that is fantastic, but I want it even lower.
I found out that 24% of my constituents work

226
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,591
in the area of the West Midlands Combined
Authority, so can I press my right hon. Friend

227
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:16,870
just a little further about what she thinks
is needed in the West Midlands Combined Authority

228
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,680
to improve employment still more?

229
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:28,500
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend,
and, of course, I have had the advantage of

230
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,090
having visited his beautiful constituency.
But in relation to the midlands, we have a

231
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:40,170
very strong ambition to make the midlands
an engine for growth in the UK. That is why

232
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,310
we have plans for the midlands engine that
demonstrate that, when we say we are going

233
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,590
to build an economy that works for everyone,
we actually mean it. In the autumn statement,

234
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,700
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed
things such as the £5 million for a Birmingham

235
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,130
rail hub and a £250 million midlands engine
investment fund, and we will shortly be publishing

236
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,940
a strategy for the midlands engine. But I
repeat the point that I made: for the west

237
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,650
midlands, having the devolution deal, having
the Mayor and having the right person elected

238
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,600
as Mayor, who I think will be Andy Street,
is absolutely crucial.

239
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,370
>>Ian Murray (Edinburgh South) (Lab): Happy
new year, Mr Speaker. Sir Ivan Rogers, in

240
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,990
his resignation letter, said that people may
have to deliver messages to the Government

241
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,000
that Ministers may find disagreeable. So here
is a message that the Prime Minister may find

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,630
disagreeable: her lack of priority for the
single market is putting jobs in Scotland

243
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,940
and the economy at risk. That means her Government
are as big a threat to the Union as the SNP.

244
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,710
Her Government are not worthy of the trust
of Scots, let alone their blind trust, so

245
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,870
will the Prime Minister take this opportunity
to apologise for threatening the Union and

246
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,130
give a solemn promise to every single person
in this country that they will not be a penny

247
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,440
worse off after a Tory Brexit?

248
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,390
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman will
be very well aware that I want to see the

249
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,600
best possible trade deal for the United Kingdom
with the EU and the best possible deal for

250
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,190
trading with and operating within the single
European market. When we enter the negotiations,

251
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,390
obviously, that is one of the issues that
I have said that I want to see, and we will

252
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,020
be out there and be delivering on it. Unlike
the sort of downplaying that the hon. Gentleman

253
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,510
does about the approach that we are taking,
I have to say that it is this Government that

254
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,510
is ambitious for the opportunities that are
available to this country once we leave the

255
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,720
European Union.

256
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,880
>>Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury) (Con): Cheshire
schools in areas of rurality and areas of

257
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,050
high deprivation will receive some of the
lowest per-pupil funding rates in the country

258
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,490
under the new proposed funding formula. Does
the Prime Minister agree that these discrepancies

259
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,960
must be addressed to ensure that Eddisbury
pupils get the best possible start in life?

260
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,220
>>The Prime Minister: I think everybody recognises
that the way that schools have been funded

261
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,612
in the past has been unfair and many pupils
have been missing out. That is why I think

262
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:07,120
it is right for us to look at bringing forward
a new fair funding formula, making sure that

263
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,450
funding is attached to children’s needs.
Of course we recognise the particular issues

264
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:17,340
of rural areas in this, and that is why, within
the fair funding formula, additional funding

265
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,530
for such schools has been included. But, of
course, the Department for Education has this

266
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,830
out for consultation at the moment, and I
would urge my hon. Friend to make her representations

267
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,070
as part of that consultation.

268
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:36,420
>>Tracy Brabin (Batley and Spen) (Lab): Dewsbury
hospital A&amp;E is set for a downgrade this

269
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,380
year. Over Christmas, I had constituents who
were waiting 20 hours for a bed in a facility

270
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,620
that might not even exist next year. Will
the Prime Minister please face reality and

271
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,100
act now to stop this vital A&E service from
disappearing?

272
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,750
>>The Prime Minister: What the hon. Lady is
referring to, of course, is the plans that

273
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,060
are being put forward at local level to consider—[Interruption.]

274
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:13,160
>>Mr Speaker: Order. There is far too much
noise. I must say to the hon. Member for Dewsbury

275
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,091
(Paula Sherriff) that if she were behaving
like this in another public place she would

276
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:20,060
probably be subject to an antisocial behaviour
order.

277
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:29,620
>>The Prime Minister: I return to the point,
Mr Speaker. Decisions about services in the

278
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,270
local area are rightly taken by the local
national health service, because we believe

279
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,300
that it is local clinicians, and also local
patients and leaders, who know what is best

280
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,620
for their areas. So it is about trying to
tailor the services to provide the best possible

281
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,270
services for the needs of local people, modernising
the care and facilities, and making services

282
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,551
appropriate to the local area. This trust
has an extensive improvement plan to ensure

283
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:58,240
that both hospitals within it can care for
patients attending accident and emergency

284
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,610
in as timely a way as possible.

285
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,950
>>Richard Fuller (Bedford) (Con): Next Thursday
evening, I will host the first session of

286
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,350
the Bedford community business school, free
of charge and open to all, with 250 local

287
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,610
people sharing a passion for entrepreneurship
and learning tips about business from national

288
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,200
and local business leaders. Will my right
hon. Friend ensure that her forthcoming industrial

289
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,270
strategy has at its heart the passion and
the interest of Britain’s small business

290
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,400
leaders and entrepreneurs?

291
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,980
>>The Prime Minister: I can absolutely give
my hon. Friend that commitment. What is important

292
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,880
is that the industrial strategy will be looking
to the economy of the future—what sort of

293
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,710
economy we want in this country. Crucial to
that will be the growth that is generated

294
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,920
by entrepreneurs and by small businesses—by
the very passion that he has spoken about.

295
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,280
We want to see an environment in which those
who can grow can emerge and develop to provide

296
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,610
future jobs for people and contribute to the
strength of our economy. That is what the

297
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,550
industrial strategy is about; I absolutely
agree with my hon. Friend.

298
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:11,180
>>Norman Lamb (North Norfolk) (LD): The Prime
Minister, I am sure, will understand, despite

299
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:17,970
the reassurances, that there are genuine and
really serious concerns among staff across

300
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,850
the NHS and the care system, and patients
and their families, about the pressure that

301
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:28,440
they are under. For that reason, MPs from
her own party, from the Labour party and from

302
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,800
my party have come together to call for the
Government to establish an NHS and care convention

303
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,540
to engage with the public, so that we can
come up with a long-term settlement for the

304
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,410
NHS and care. Would the Prime Minister be
prepared to meet us to discuss it, so that

305
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,010
she can hear our case?

306
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,810
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise, obviously,
the interest and the attention that the right

307
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,820
hon. Gentleman has given to these issues—of
course, he is a former Health Minister—and

308
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,400
I would be happy to meet him and others, as
he suggests.

309
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:07,150
>>Edward Argar (Charnwood) (Con): There can
be nothing as distressing for a parent as

310
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:14,390
the death of their child, particularly where
that child has been murdered. That is what

311
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:20,380
happened to the two ladies, one of them a
constituent of mine, who set up Justice After

312
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,940
Acquittal, successfully campaigning for voluntary
national standards of support by the Crown

313
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,220
Prosecution Service and by the police for
the families of murder victims following an

314
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,180
acquittal. Those standards are due to be launched
here next Tuesday. Will the Prime Minister

315
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,940
join me in paying tribute to the determination
and energy with which they have campaigned

316
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,150
for their cause, and will she continue to
ensure, as she always has done, that the voices

317
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,730
of the victims of crime and their families
are always listened to?

318
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,820
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a very important point. I am very happy to

319
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,330
join him in paying tribute to these two campaigners.
Indeed, I am sure that the whole House would

320
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,440
want to pay tribute to the work that they
are doing. As he says, I remain committed

321
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,290
to ensuring that the voices of victims are
heard. That is what I did when I was Home

322
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:15,710
Secretary, if we look at issues such as introducing
new measures to tackle modern slavery, strengthening

323
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,450
the Independent Police Complaints Commission
and legislating in relation to police complaints

324
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,360
and discipline systems to strengthen public
confidence in policing, and a number of other

325
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,460
actions that I took. I am very pleased to
say that my right hon. Friend the current

326
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,740
Home Secretary is taking that same passion
to ensuring that the voices of the victims

327
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,250
of crime are heard and is taking that forward.

328
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,490
>>Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh South West) (SNP):
Across the United Kingdom, many banks are

329
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,150
accelerating their closure of local branches,
with adverse effects on vulnerable and older

330
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,950
people and adverse effects on the high street.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is closing down

331
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:56,220
branches across Scotland, including those
at Juniper Green and Chesser in my constituency.

332
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,910
Local convenience stores are taking the strain
of processing bills and often face exorbitant

333
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:07,740
bank charges for the privilege of doing so.
Will the Prime Minister meet me to discuss

334
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,460
how we can realise a situation where banking
across the UK services customers and the real

335
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
economy?

336
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,480
>>The Prime Minister: The issue of bank branches
and, indeed, of the accessibility of bank

337
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,780
services is one that is for individual banks
themselves to take and consider, and of course

338
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,700
there are many ways in which people are now
accessing bank services other than by going

339
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,710
physically into an actual bank branch, but
I will certainly look at the issue that the

340
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,710
hon. and learned Lady has raised.

341
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:43,080
>>Dr James Davies (Vale of Clwyd) (Con): Building
a country that works for everyone means doing

342
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,900
even more to tackle the economic and social
deprivation that has come to afflict pockets

343
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:56,410
of seaside towns such as Rhyl in my constituency.
Will my right hon. Friend therefore support

344
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:02,390
Growth Track 360, a locally developed plan
to invest in rail infrastructure to help unlock

345
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,140
the true potential of the north Wales and
Mersey-Dee economic region as an integral

346
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:16,120
part of the northern powerhouse, connected
to the rest of the country via

347
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
the proposed HS2 hub at Crewe?

348
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,310
>>The Prime Minister: I welcome the establishment
of the north Wales and Mersey-Dee rail taskforce

349
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,560
and the work that it is doing. The plan that
my hon. Friend mentions sets out an ambitious

350
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,110
programme of improvements for the area, and
I am sure it will be prioritising the most

351
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,070
promising options. I can say to him that the
Department for Transport will continue to

352
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,290
work closely with the taskforce and with the
Welsh Government to consider what can be jointly

353
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,290
accomplished.

354
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:48,410
>>Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (SNP):
As Pensions Minister, Steve Webb misled the

355
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:53,210
public about the value of the single-rate
pension. He also gave us the Pensions Act

356
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,990
2011. He was rightly booted out by the voters,
yet is now deemed suitable for a knighthood.

357
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,610
Does the Prime Minister not understand that,
unless this Government take action to help

358
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,931
the struggling WASPI women, that knighthood
will be the final insult to these women?

359
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:13,530
>>The Prime Minister: Action has been taken
on the issue in relation to women’s pensions.

360
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,640
The Government took action to ensure that
the number of people who were affected and

361
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,820
the period for which they were affected would
be reduced, and money was put in to ensure

362
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,480
that that was possible. If the hon. Gentleman
looks at the new structure that is being put

363
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,850
in place for pensions, he will see that women
will actually be some of the greater beneficiaries

364
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,850
of the new structure.

365
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,110
>>Chris White (Warwick and Leamington) (Con):
I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister

366
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:45,650
has raised awareness of the importance of
child mental health this week, not least because

367
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:51,890
65% of young people requiring mental health
support in south Warwickshire last year had

368
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,190
to wait over 12 weeks before starting treatment.
Will my right hon. Friend outline how the

369
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,710
new proposals will improve our support network
for such vulnerable young people?

370
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:07,400
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue, which was of course alluded

371
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,490
to earlier in this session of Prime Minister’s
questions. We are investing more in mental

372
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,300
health than ever before—we are spending
a record £11.4 billion a year—and it was

373
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,990
of course the Conservative-led Government
that introduced parity of esteem between mental

374
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:27,360
and physical health, but as I said earlier,
there is more for us to do in ensuring that

375
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,200
appropriate care is available for people.
I cited an example earlier of where I saw

376
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,820
excellent work being done to provide care
and support for people in the community, which

377
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,550
was relieving pressure on accident and emergency,
but also ensuring that people were getting

378
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,930
the best possible care for them, and that
is obviously what we want to see.

379
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,090
>>John Woodcock (Barrow and Furness) (Lab/Co-op):
The strained accident and emergency provision

380
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,240
in my constituency is under review, and the
community further up the Cumbrian coast risks

381
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,620
losing 24-hour access to accident and emergency
and to consultant-led maternity from its local

382
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,680
hospital. I understand that the Prime Minister
will say that these decisions are to be made

383
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,400
locally, but will she at least say that she
can understand the anxiety of expectant mums

384
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:24,310
who face a 40-mile journey on difficult roads,
which are often blocked, if they have a difficult

385
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,310
birth?

386
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:32,200
>>The Prime Minister: The problems that are
facing the health service in Cumbria are widely

387
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,230
recognised, and I do understand the concerns
of local people about the services that will

388
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,560
be available for them. We have put robust
national support in place to address some

389
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,290
of the long-standing challenges in Cumbria,
and we are developing a lasting plan to deliver

390
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,510
the high-quality, sustainable services that
patients rightly expect.

391
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:55,400
The hon. Gentleman is right that these specific
decisions are being taken locally, and no

392
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,890
final decisions have been taken. I recognise
the concern that he has raised previously,

393
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,320
particularly about services at West Cumberland
hospital. There will be considerable involvement

394
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,820
in taking those decisions, but as I say, we
do recognise the local concerns about some

395
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,790
of the long-standing challenges for health
service provision in Cumbria.

396
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:24,970
>>Dr Caroline Johnson (Sleaford and North
Hykeham) (Con): I know from my career in medicine

397
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:29,619
that the men and women of our East Midlands
ambulance service do a brave and sterling

398
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,030
job for the people of Sleaford and North Hykeham
and others, saving people’s lives every

399
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:44,800
day. East Midlands ambulance service responded
to a total of 11,662 999 calls over the Christmas

400
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,080
bank holiday weekend alone, 2,500 of which
were in Lincolnshire. Will the Prime Minister

401
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,160
join me in paying tribute to their dedication,
particularly over the busy winter period,

402
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,330
and tell the House what more the Government
can do to support our ambulance services and

403
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:09,110
improve response times in rural areas such
as Sleaford and North Hykeham?

404
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,010
>>The Prime Minister: May I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and also for bringing

405
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:21,080
her personal experience as a medical professional
to this issue? I am very happy to join her

406
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,890
in paying tribute to the men and women of
the ambulance service for the dedication and

407
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,960
commitment that they show. She asks what the
Government have been doing. We recognise that

408
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,390
ambulance services are very busy, which is
why we see over 2,000 more paramedics now

409
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,560
compared with 2010, and we are increasing
paramedic training places by over 60% this

410
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,270
year. Also, the Department of Health, NHS
Employers and ambulance unions have agreed

411
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,290
changes to the compensation for paramedics,
potentially giving them a pay increase of

412
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,300
up to £14,000 as they progress. We recognise
the excellent work that they do.

413
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,510
>>Gavin Robinson (Belfast East) (DUP): May
I commend the Prime Minister for her considered

414
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,300
statement last night and, indeed, for the
words that she has given this afternoon? She

415
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,330
knows our commitment to the institutions in
Northern Ireland, but would she agree that

416
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:19,300
nothing can be, or should be, gained from
threatening the peace process, the progress

417
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,330
that we have made or the institutions that
we have fought so hard to sustain in Northern

418
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,330
Ireland?

419
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:31,520
>>The Prime Minister: The progress that has
been made in Northern Ireland has been hard

420
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,860
won, and we must all recognise that we do
not want to put that progress in jeopardy.

421
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:42,620
That is why it is so important for the Government,
and for all parties, to work as hard as we

422
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,220
can to see a resolution to this issue, so
that we can see a return to the power-sharing

423
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,080
institutions and ensure that the hard-won
progress can be continued.

424
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,500
>>Nicky Morgan (Loughborough) (Con): I warmly
welcome what my right hon. Friend said about

425
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,120
children’s mental health earlier this week,
but may I draw her attention to another burning

426
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,820
injustice? My constituent Paula Edwards has
been battling cancer for four years. She is

427
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,040
recovering from an operation and has taken
28 weeks off work. She is still employed and

428
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,740
is on half pay, yet her working tax credits
have been stopped, which means that she is

429
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,970
worrying about how to make ends meet rather
than focusing on her recovery. Will my right

430
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,790
hon. Friend ask the Treasury to look at this,
perhaps in the course of Budget preparations?

431
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:32,840
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my right hon.
Friend for her comments about the mental health

432
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,580
announcements that I have made. I am sorry
to hear of the particular difficulties that

433
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:43,930
her constituent is experiencing and the distress
that they have caused her. Of course, working

434
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,320
tax credits provide support for low-income
families in work and are designed to incentivise

435
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,380
people to increase their working hours. With
the new universal credit system, we will obviously

436
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:02,700
have a system of benefits with single, streamlined
payments that encourages work, but I am sure

437
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,801
the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would
be happy to look at the individual case that

438
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,530
my right hon. Friend has raised and the issue
that she has set out.
