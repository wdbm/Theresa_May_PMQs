1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,190
>>Helen Jones (Warrington North) (Lab): If
she will list her official engagements for

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,190
Wednesday 25 January.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,290
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): As
the response from the whole House showed,

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,919
we all indeed welcome the Speaker of the Burmese
Parliament and his colleagues to see our deliberations

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,919
today.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,872
I am sure that the whole House will join me
in sending our thoughts to the friends and

7
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:23,690
family of the police officer who was shot
in Belfast over the weekend. The Police Service

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,320
of Northern Ireland does a superb job in keeping
us safe and secure, and has our fullest support.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,860
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others, and in addition to

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,261
my duties in this House I shall have further
such meetings later today. Later this week,

11
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:43,149
I will travel to the United States for talks
with President Trump.

12
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:50,600
>>Helen Jones: I join the Prime Minister in
sending good wishes to the police officer

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,870
who was shot in Belfast.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:00,300
They are the best drivers of social mobility,
and 99% of them are rated good or outstanding,

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,940
while 65% of their places are in the most
deprived areas of this country, so why is

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,040
the Prime Minister introducing cuts that threaten
the very existence of maintained nursery schools?

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,190
Is it not true that when it comes to social
mobility, her actions speak far louder than

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,300
her words?

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,670
>>The Prime Minister: I want to ensure, and
this Government want to ensure, good-quality

20
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:33,420
education at every age and every stage for
children in this country. That is why we are

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,610
looking at improving the number of good school
places. The hon. Lady talks about my record

22
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,020
speaking louder than words, so let me point
out that I was very proud as chairman of an

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,490
education authority in London in the 1990s
to introduce nursery school places for every

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,920
three and four-year-old whose parent wanted
them.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,520
>>Chris Philp (Croydon South) (Con): The Prime
Minister laid out a clear and bold plan for

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:13,810
Brexit in her speech last week. Hon. Members
quite rightly want an opportunity to scrutinise

27
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,970
the plan. Does the Prime Minister agree that
the best way of facilitating that scrutiny

28
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,790
would be a Government White Paper laying out
our vision for a global Britain based on free

29
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,480
trade in goods and services that will be to
the benefit of us and other European countries?

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,700
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
the question of parliamentary scrutiny. I

31
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,140
have made clear, as have senior Ministers,
that we will ensure that Parliament has every

32
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,070
opportunity to carry out such scrutiny as
we go through this process. I set out that

33
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,790
bold plan for a global Britain last week.
I recognise that there is an appetite in the

34
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,069
House to see it set out in a White Paper—I
have heard my hon. Friend’s question, and

35
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,700
my right hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe
(Anna Soubry) asked a question in the same

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,890
vein last week—and I can confirm that our
plan will be set out in a White Paper published

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,230
for the House.

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:21,170
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): I
join the Prime Minister in expressing the

39
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,540
condolences of, I am sure, the whole House
to the family of the police officer who lost

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,780
his life over the weekend in Northern Ireland.

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:40,069
The Prime Minister has wasted 80 days between
the original judgment and the appeal. She

42
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:46,100
has finally admitted today, after pressure
from all sides, that there will be a White

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:55,660
Paper. May we know when that White Paper will
be available to us, and why it is taking so

44
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,370
long for us to get it?

45
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:08,630
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
asked for debates. I made very clear that

46
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,300
there would always be debates in the House,
and there have been and will continue to be.

47
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,030
He asked for votes. There have been votes
in the House; the House voted overwhelmingly

48
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,930
for the Government to trigger article 50 before
the end of March this year. He asked for a

49
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,360
plan. As we heard from my hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp), I

50
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,720
have set out a clear plan for a bold future
for Britain. He and others asked for a White

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,430
Paper, and I have made clear that there will
be a White Paper.

52
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,990
What I am also clear about is that the right
hon. Gentleman always asks about process—about

53
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:52,639
the means to an end. The Government and I
are focusing on the outcomes. We are focusing

54
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,360
on a truly global Britain, building a stronger
future for this country, the right deal for

55
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,030
Britain, and Britain out of the European Union.

56
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,000
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was not complicated.
I simply asked when the White Paper would

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,490
come out. Will it be published before or at
the same time as the Bill that is apparently

58
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,810
about to be published?

59
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,700
Last week I asked the Prime Minister repeatedly
to clarify whether her Government were prepared

60
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:31,770
to pay to secure tariff-free access to the
single European market. She repeatedly refused

61
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,800
to answer the question, so I will ask her
again. Are her Government ruling out paying

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,230
a fee for tariff-free access to the single
market or the bespoke customs union to which

63
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,620
she also referred in her speech?

64
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,510
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
has mentioned the issue of timing. There are

65
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,720
actually two separate issues. The House has
voted overwhelmingly that article 50 should

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,669
be triggered before the end of March 2017.
Following the Supreme Court judgment, a Bill

67
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,800
will be provided for the House, and there
will be proper debates on it in the Chamber

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,240
and in another place. There is then the separate
question of the publication of the plan that

69
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,930
I have set out, a bold vision for Britain
for the future. I will do that in the White

70
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,220
Paper. The right hon. Gentleman knows that
one of our objectives is the best possible

71
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,590
free trade with the European Union, and that
is what we will be out there negotiating for.

72
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,820
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Some of this is very worrying
for many Members, but, more important, it

73
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,350
is worrying for many other people. For example,
the chief executive of Nissan was given assurances

74
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,900
by the Prime Minister’s Business Secretary
about future trade arrangements with Europe,

75
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,360
but now says that Nissan will

76
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,169
“have to re-evaluate the situation”

77
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,460
in relation to its investments in Britain.

78
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,479
The Prime Minister is threatening the EU that
unless it gives in to her demands she will

79
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:12,290
turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven
off the coast of Europe. Labour Members are

80
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,590
very well aware of the consequences that that
would have—the damage that it would do to

81
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,780
jobs and living standards, and to our public
services. Is the Prime Minister now going

82
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,290
to rule out the bargain basement threat that
she made in her speech at Lancaster House?

83
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,610
>>The Prime Minister: I expect us to get a
good deal for trading relationships with the

84
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,669
European Union, but I am also clear that this
Government will not sign up to a bad deal

85
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:45,160
for the United Kingdom. As for the threats
that the right hon. Gentleman claims might

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,330
happen—he often uses those phrases and talks
about workers’ rights—perhaps he should

87
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,009
listen to his former colleague in this House,
the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who today

88
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,009
said,

89
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,650
“to give credit to the Government…I don’t
think they want to weaken workers’ rights”,

90
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,990
and goes on to say,

91
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,500
“I’ve seen no evidence from the conversations
I’ve had with senior members of the Government

92
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,310
that that’s their aspiration or their intention
or something they want to do. Which is good.”

93
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,180
As usual with Labour, the right hand is not
talking to the far-left.

94
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:33,879
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The evidence of what the
Tory party and this Government really think

95
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:40,820
about workers’ rights was there for all
to see yesterday: a private Member’s Bill

96
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,920
under the ten-minute rule by a Tory MP to
tear up parts of the International Labour

97
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,321
Organisation convention, talking down the
Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Great

98
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:55,970
Grimsby (Melanie Onn) to protect European
workers’ rights that have been obtained

99
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,279
in this country. That is the real agenda of
the Tory party.

100
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:10,339
What the Prime Minister is doing is petulantly
aiming a threat at our public services with

101
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:17,270
her threats about a bargain basement Britain.
Is her priority our struggling NHS, those

102
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,600
denied social care, and children having their
school funding cut, or is it once again further

103
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,769
cuts in big business taxation to make the
rich even better off?

104
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:35,819
>>The Prime Minister: I simply remind the
right hon. Gentleman that I have been very

105
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:40,610
clear that this Government will protect workers’
rights; indeed, we have a review of modern

106
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,130
employment law to ensure all employment legislation
is keeping up with the modern labour market.

107
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,709
One of the objectives I set out in my plan
for our negotiating objectives was to protect

108
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,230
workers’ rights.

109
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,430
The right hon. Gentleman talks about threats
to public services. I will tell him what the

110
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,240
threat to public services would be: a Labour
Government borrowing £500 million extra.

111
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,649
That would destroy our economy and mean no
funding for our public services.

112
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:18,170
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The threat to workers’
rights is there every day: 6 million people

113
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,660
earning less than the living wage; and many
people—nearly 1 million—on zero-hours

114
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,009
contracts with no protection being offered
by this Government. What they are doing is

115
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:32,459
offering once again the bargain basement alternative.

116
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:39,540
Will the Prime Minister also take this opportunity
today to congratulate the 100,000 people who

117
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,670
marched in Britain last weekend to highlight
women’s rights after President Trump’s

118
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:52,800
inauguration, and to express their concerns
about his misogyny? Many have concerns that

119
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,739
in the Prime Minister’s forthcoming meeting
with President Trump she will be prepared

120
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:05,509
to offer up for sacrifice the opportunity
for American companies to come in and take

121
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:12,899
over parts of our NHS or our public services.
Will she assure the House that in any trade

122
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,029
deal none of those things will be offered
up as a bargaining chip?

123
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,670
>>The Prime Minister: I again point out to
the right hon. Gentleman that it is this Government

124
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:30,449
who have introduced the national living wage
and this Government who have made changes

125
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,319
to zero-hours contracts.

126
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:37,290
On the issue of my visit to the United States
of America, I am pleased that I am able to

127
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,990
meet President Trump so early in his Administration.
That is a sign of the strength of the special

128
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,540
relationship between the United Kingdom and
the United States of America—a special relationship

129
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,670
on which he and I intend to build. But I also
say to the Leader of the Opposition that I

130
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,439
am not afraid to speak frankly to a President
of the United States; I am able to do that

131
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:07,189
because we have that special relationship—a
special relationship that the right hon. Gentleman

132
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:09,980
would never have with the United States.

133
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:18,019
>>Jeremy Corbyn: We would never allow Britain
to be sold off on the cheap. How confident

134
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,439
is the Prime Minister of getting a good deal
for “global Britain” from a President

135
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:28,839
who says he wants to put America first, buy
American and build a wall between his country

136
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,699
and Mexico?

137
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:37,029
Article 50 was not about a court judgment
against the Government. What it signified

138
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:43,179
was the bad judgment of this Government: the
bad judgment of prioritising corporate tax

139
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:48,970
cuts over investment in national health and
social care; the bad judgment of threatening

140
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:57,889
European partners while offering a blank cheque
to President Trump; and the bad judgment of

141
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:03,560
wanting to turn Britain into a bargain basement
tax haven. So will the Prime Minister offer

142
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,050
some clarity and certainty and withdraw the
threats to destroy the social structure of

143
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,149
this country by turning us into the bargain
basement she clearly threatens?

144
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,439
>>The Prime Minister: We will be out around
the world with the EU, America and other countries

145
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:24,720
negotiating good free trade deals for this
country that will bring prosperity to this

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,699
country. The right hon. Gentleman wants to
talk about Brexit, but I have to say to him

147
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:34,149
that he is the leader of his party and he
cannot even agree with his shadow Chancellor

148
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,739
about Brexit. The shadow Chancellor cannot
agree with the shadow Brexit Secretary, the

149
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,404
shadow Brexit secretary disagrees with the
shadow Home Secretary, and the shadow Home

150
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:49,949
Secretary has to ring up the leader and tell
him to change his mind. He talks about us

151
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:59,240
standing up for Britain; they cannot speak
for themselves and they will never speak for

152
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,279
Britain.

153
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:11,620
>>David Warburton (Somerton and Frome) (Con):
On 27 December, another young woman lost her

154
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:19,209
life driving through the west country on the
A303. In the past decade, more than 1,000

155
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,480
people have been killed or injured on that
road. For 40 years, Governments have promised

156
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,129
to dual the lethal parts of the road where
two lanes become three or three lanes become

157
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,779
two, with no central reservation. The queues
on the road are also legendary. I know that

158
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,429
the Government are committed to an upgrade,
but will the Prime Minister assure us that

159
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:43,910
the proposed tunnel beneath Stonehenge will
not hold up essential work elsewhere, and

160
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,959
that we will soon see cones on the road and
spades in the ground?

161
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,559
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue, and he is absolutely right

162
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:57,319
to do that. I can assure him that we are working
generally to improve the safety of our roads.

163
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:03,339
He refers specifically to the issue of the
A303 and to the tragic incident that happened

164
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:09,170
on 27 December. We have committed to creating
a dual carriageway on the A303 from the M3

165
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,959
to the M5. I understand that Highways England
has recently launched a consultation into

166
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,450
the route under Stonehenge, and my hon. Friend
will want to look closely at that issue. This

167
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,239
is all part of our £2 billion investment
in road improvements that will improve connections

168
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:29,410
in the south-west, but I can assure him that
we have road safety at the forefront of our

169
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,410
mind.

170
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:36,209
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): May I begin
by wishing everybody a happy Burns day, and

171
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,359
by extending congratulations to The Scotsman
newspaper, which is celebrating its bicentenary

172
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,999
today?

173
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:50,009
Yesterday, the Government lost in the Supreme
Court, and today we have had a welcome U-turn

174
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:57,819
on a White Paper on Brexit. In the spirit
of progress for Parliament, and in advance

175
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:02,850
of her meeting President Trump, will the Prime
Minister tell Parliament what she wants to

176
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,470
achieve in a UK-US trade deal?

177
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,709
>>The Prime Minister: First, I join the right
hon. Gentleman in wishing a happy Burns day

178
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,489
to everybody and in recognising the bicentenary
of The Scotsman. I am sure everybody in the

179
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:22,550
House will join me in that. He asks what we
want to achieve in our arrangements with the

180
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,589
United States. It is very simple: we want
to achieve an arrangement that ensures that

181
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,579
the interests of the United Kingdom are put
first, and that is what I will be doing. We

182
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,379
want to see trade arrangements with the United
States, and with other parts of the world,

183
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,739
that can increase our trade and bring prosperity
and growth to the United Kingdom. Then, my

184
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,019
aim for this Government is to ensure that
the economy works for everyone in every part

185
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,949
of the United Kingdom.

186
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:53,239
>>Angus Robertson: The European Union, which
we are still part of, has among the highest

187
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:57,809
food safety standards anywhere in the world,
and we are proud on our continent to have

188
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,559
public national health systems. The United
States, on the other hand, is keen to have

189
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,800
health systems that are fully open to private
competition and it wants to export genetically

190
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,699
modified organisms, beef raised using growth
hormones and chicken meat washed with chlorinated

191
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,520
water. Will the Prime Minister tell President
Trump that she is not prepared to lower our

192
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,890
food and safety standards or to open our health
systems up for privatisation? Or does she

193
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,520
believe that that is a price worth paying
for a UK-US trade deal?

194
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,190
>>The Prime Minister: We will be looking for
a UK-US trade deal that improves trade between

195
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,291
our two countries, that will bring prosperity
and growth to this country and that will ensure

196
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,330
that we can bring jobs to this country as
well. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman

197
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,920
that, in doing that, we will put UK interests
and UK values first.

198
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,360
>>Kevin Hollinrake (Thirsk and Malton) (Con):
Historic per capita spending in our regions,

199
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,690
including Yorkshire, when compared with London
is up to 40% lower for our local authorities,

200
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,621
up to 50% lower for our schools and up to
60% lower for our transport projects. Does

201
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:10,860
the Prime Minister agree that, if we want
to build a country that works for everyone,

202
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,970
we need a fair funding deal that works for
everyone?

203
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,030
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the issues
that my hon. Friend has raised, and I can

204
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:25,990
assure him that our commitment in relation
to the northern parts of England, including

205
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,590
Yorkshire, is absolutely clear. We want to
back business growth right across the north,

206
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,981
and we are backing the northern powerhouse
to help the great cities and towns of the

207
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,810
north to pool their strengths and take on
the world. Yorkshire local enterprise partnerships

208
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,010
have received an additional £156 million
in Government funding this week, and we are

209
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,591
spending a record £13 billion on transport
across the north. As a result, there are more

210
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:51,520
people in work in Yorkshire and the Humber
than ever before, and the employment rate

211
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,400
is at a record high. That is good news for
people in the region and good news for our

212
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,550
economy as a whole.

213
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:03,450
>>Dr Philippa Whitford (Central Ayrshire)
(SNP): The European Medicines Agency provides

214
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,160
a single drug licensing system for 500 million
people and results in the UK having drugs

215
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,680
licensed six to 12 months ahead of countries
like Canada and Australia. Yesterday, the

216
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,540
Health Secretary stated that the UK will not
be in the EMA, so can the Prime Minister confirm

217
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,710
this and explain how she will prevent delayed
drug access for UK patients?

218
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,050
>>The Prime Minister: There are a number of
organisations that we are part of as members

219
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,280
of the European Union. As part of the work
that we are doing to look at the United Kingdom’s

220
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,900
future after we leave the European Union,
we are looking at the arrangements we can

221
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:49,110
put in place in relation to those issues.
The pharmaceutical industry in this country

222
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:55,400
is a very important part of our economy, and
the ability of people to access these new

223
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,800
drugs is also important. I assure the hon.
Lady that we are looking seriously at this

224
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
and will ensure that we have the arrangements
that we need.

225
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,500
>>Kit Malthouse (North West Hampshire) (Con):
Too few British entrepreneurs are connecting

226
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,480
with the capital they need to start and grow.
As part of her industrial strategy, which

227
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,440
will be looking at access to capital, will
the Prime Minister order a review of the enterprise

228
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,210
investment scheme and the seed enterprise
investment scheme in the hope that they can

229
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,360
be simplified, helping to create the large
pools of buccaneering capital that British

230
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,050
industry needs?

231
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:33,640
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue. He has long been a champion

232
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,670
of entrepreneurship in this country, and I
can tell him that in the industrial strategy

233
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,560
we are committed to providing the best environment
for business. The Treasury has established

234
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:50,700
a patient capital review, for example, with
a panel chaired by Sir Damon Buffini to look

235
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,250
at the barriers that exist to long-term investment.
We are also increasing investment in venture

236
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,760
capital by the British Business Bank by £400
million, and that will unlock £1 billion

237
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,230
of new finance. The Treasury is going to be
publishing a consultation in the spring examining

238
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,720
these issues, and I am sure my hon. Friend
will wish to contribute and respond to that.

239
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,200
>>Lilian Greenwood (Nottingham South) (Lab):
Four-and-a-half years ago, my constituents

240
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,060
Chris and Lydia Leek were on a family holiday
on the Greek island of Zante when their son,

241
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,890
Jamie, was hit and killed by a speeding motorbike—it
was his ninth birthday. The rider was convicted

242
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:35,080
but has appealed against his sentence and,
to date, remains a free man. Will the Prime

243
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,280
Minister agree to meet Chris and Lydia to
discuss how they can finally secure justice

244
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,780
for Jamie?

245
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:49,320
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to look
at the tragic case that the hon. Lady describes.

246
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,550
Our thoughts must be with Chris and Lydia
at the terrible loss they experienced. As

247
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,700
to the issue of what is happening in terms
of the Greek criminal justice system, of course

248
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,840
that is a matter for the Greek authorities,
but I will look seriously at this case and

249
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,370
see if there is anything that the Foreign
Office can do.

250
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,510
>>Mr Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con): President
Trump has repeatedly said that he will bring

251
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:21,550
back torture as an instrument of policy. When
she sees him on Friday, will the Prime Minister

252
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,110
make it clear that in no circumstances will
she permit Britain to be dragged into facilitating

253
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,730
that torture, as we were after 11 September?

254
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,630
>>The Prime Minister: I assure my right hon.
Friend that our position on torture is clear:

255
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,240
we do not sanction torture and do not get
involved in it. That will continue to be our

256
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
position.

257
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,040
>>Andy Slaughter (Hammersmith) (Lab): Seventy
per cent. of my constituents voted remain,

258
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,150
15% are citizens of other EU countries, and
almost all do not trust the Prime Minister’s

259
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,930
Government to negotiate a deal that secures
the future prosperity of London and the UK.

260
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,650
Will she give this House a veto on the deal
that she does, or will she put the deal to

261
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,510
a referendum of the British people?

262
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:13,860
>>The Prime Minister: People voted differently
across the country. Parts of the country voted

263
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,150
to remain and parts of the country voted to
leave. What we do now is unite behind the

264
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,490
result of the vote that took place. We come
together as a country, we go out there, we

265
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,200
make a success of this, and we ensure that
we build a truly global Britain that will

266
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,320
bring jobs to the hon. Gentleman’s constituency
and for his constituents.

267
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,330
>>Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con):
This week, Milton Keynes celebrates its 50th

268
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,230
birthday. [Hon. Members: “Hear, hear.”]
We have been the most successful of new cities

269
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,880
and have one of the highest rates of economic
growth. Does the Prime Minister agree that

270
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Milton Keynes has a great future and will
be central to delivering this Government’s

271
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,180
ambitions?

272
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:04,500
>>The Prime Minister: I join my hon. Friend
in marking Milton Keynes’ 50th birthday.

273
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,410
I understand that he has secured a Westminster
Hall debate on the subject later today, so

274
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,210
I congratulate him on that. Milton Keynes
is a great example of what can be achieved

275
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:20,070
with a clear plan and strong local leadership.
We are providing additional funding for the

276
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,730
east-west rail project, which he supported
through his chairing of the east-west rail

277
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,070
all-party parliamentary group, and the Oxford
to Cambridge expressway road scheme. We will

278
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,710
see a country that works for everyone. Milton
Keynes has had a great 50 years, but I am

279
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,330
sure that it will have a great future as well.

280
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,360
>>Kelvin Hopkins (Luton North) (Lab): Last
week, a freight train from China arrived in

281
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,260
Barking after using the channel tunnel, demonstrating
the massive potential of rail freight. However,

282
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,880
continental rail wagons and lorry trailers
on trains cannot be accommodated on Britain’s

283
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,610
historic rail network because its loading
gauge is too small. Will the Prime Minister

284
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,940
therefore consider giving positive support
to the GB freight route scheme, which will

285
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,080
provide a large-gauge freight line linking
all the nations and regions of Britain both

286
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,630
to each other and to Europe and Asia? It would
take 5 million lorry journeys off Britain’s

287
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,630
roads every year.

288
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:14,660
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
the difference in gauges on railways here

289
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,650
and on the continent, which has obviously
been an issue for some considerable time.

290
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,890
We want to encourage rail freight, we have
been encouraging it, and we will continue

291
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,030
to do so.

292
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:35,920
>>Rebecca Pow (Taunton Deane) (Con): The Ministry
of Cake in Taunton, a company with a turnover

293
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,700
of £30 million, has recently been bought
by a French company called Mademoiselle Desserts.

294
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,300
The Ministry of Cake trades across Europe
and into China. Does the Prime Minister agree

295
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,810
that that demonstrates confidence in our economy—in
that a European company has bought into it—that

296
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:04,510
we can unlock global trade and that the south-west
is a terrific place to do business?

297
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:16,180
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely agree with
my hon. Friend. The investment of a French

298
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,820
company into the company in her constituency
shows people’s confidence in the future

299
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,140
of our economy, the fundamental strengths
of our economy and that we can unlock global

300
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,290
trade. Of course, the south-west is a very
good place to do business.

301
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:40,090
>>Peter Grant (Glenrothes) (SNP): Robert Burns
once spoke that whatever damages society,

302
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,640
or any least part of it, “this is my measure
of iniquity.”Does the Prime Minister agree

303
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,130
that that description applies perfectly to
the detained fast track system, recently found

304
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,980
to be illegal by British courts, under which
10,000 asylum seekers were denied a fair trial,

305
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,280
some of whom were probably illegally deported
to face death and torture?

306
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:07,090
>>The Prime Minister: The issue of the detained
fast track system in the asylum system is

307
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,380
one that I obviously looked at when I was
Home Secretary, and we made a number of changes

308
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:21,480
to how we operated it. However, it is built
on a simple principle: if somebody’s case

309
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,200
for asylum is such that they are almost certain
to be refused that asylum, we want to ensure

310
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,370
that they can be removed from the country
as quickly as possible, hence the detained

311
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,380
fast track system.

312
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,450
>>David Morris (Morecambe and Lunesdale) (Con):
Will my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister

313
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,430
assist in efforts to get an enterprise zone
in my constituency of Morecambe and Lunesdale

314
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,920
as part of the industrial strategy? It turns
out that the Labour council and county council

315
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,730
are talking about an enterprise zone-esque
project in the area but have not applied for

316
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,990
any funding whatsoever. Will she please assist
me in this endeavour?

317
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,210
>>The Prime Minister: I know what a champion
for Morecambe and Lunesdale my hon. Friend

318
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,450
is and has been as a Member of Parliament,
and I am sure that the Chancellor and the

319
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,260
Business Secretary will look at the issue
he has raised. I should also say how sad it

320
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,690
is that Labour councils are not willing to
put forward proposals to increase the prosperity

321
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,110
and economic growth in their areas.

322
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,960
>>Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP): When
she will next meet the First Minister of Scotland.

323
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,190
>>The Prime Minister: I will meet the First
Minister and leaders of the devolved Administrations

324
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,400
at the Joint Ministerial Committee on Monday,
but of course we regularly engage with the

325
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,330
Scottish Government on a wide range of issues.

326
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,990
>>Patrick Grady: When the Prime Minister does
eventually meet the First Minister, will the

327
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,520
Prime Minister confirm whether she supports
the principle in the Scotland Act that whatever

328
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,220
is not reserved is devolved? Will she be able
to tell the First Minister what powers will

329
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,960
come to the Scottish Parliament in the event
of Brexit? Will she confirm that the great

330
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,850
repeal Bill will not be the great power grab?

331
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,560
>>The Prime Minister: I have been very clear,
and this was echoed yesterday by my right

332
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,230
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Exiting
the European Union, that no powers that are

333
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,870
currently devolved are suddenly going to be
taken back to the United Kingdom Government.

334
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,810
We will be looking at and discussing with
the devolved Administrations how we deal with

335
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:22,290
those powers that are currently in Brussels
when they come back to the United Kingdom.

336
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,720
We want to ensure that those powers are dealt
with so that we can maintain the important

337
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,710
single market of the United Kingdom.

338
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:37,840
>>Oliver Dowden (Hertsmere) (Con): It is currently
an offence to assault a police officer, immigration

339
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,950
officer or prison officer, but it is not a
specific offence to assault an NHS worker,

340
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:49,020
whether they are a doctor, nurse or paramedic.
Does the Prime Minister agree that we should

341
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,880
consider extending a specific offence to cover
such people, to make it absolutely clear that

342
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,950
the public will not tolerate violence towards
our hard-working members of the NHS?

343
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,720
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important point. Of course, we condemn

344
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,290
assaults on anybody and any violence that
takes place. The Secretary of State for Health

345
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:13,110
has heard the case that my hon. Friend has
put and will be happy to look into that issue.

346
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,600
>>Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab): When the Prime
Minister introduces a UK agricultural policy

347
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,190
because we have left the common agricultural
policy, will the Duke of Westminster still

348
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,980
receive £407,000 a year, will the Duke of
Northumberland still receive £475,000 a year,

349
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:36,000
and will the Earl of Iveagh still receive
£915,000 a year from the British taxpayer?

350
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,010
>>Mr Speaker: The hon. Gentleman seems to
know a lot about these ducal matters; it is

351
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,800
most interesting. I am fascinated by the reply,
so let’s hear it.

352
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,980
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman is
right that one of the tasks we will have when

353
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,800
we leave the European Union is to decide what
support is provided to agriculture as a result

354
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,679
of our being outside the common agricultural
policy. I assure him that we are taking the

355
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,750
interests of all parts of the United Kingdom
into account when we look at that system and

356
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,750
what it should be in future.

357
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,690
>>Mr Speaker: Ah, yes, a Hampshire knight.

358
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:15,320
>>Sir Gerald Howarth: Last weekend, my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence

359
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:22,000
made a welcome visit to Ukraine, where he
said that freedom and democracy are not tradeable

360
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,970
commodities. As we mark the 25th anniversary
of relations between our two Parliaments,

361
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,059
may I invite my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister to declare the continuing support

362
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:36,020
of the United Kingdom for the maintenance
of an independent sovereign state in Ukraine,

363
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,390
which has been subjected to the most outrageous
annexation of part of its property by Russia?

364
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,080
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to join
my hon. Friend in confirming our commitment

365
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,650
to the independent sovereign state of Ukraine.
The Foreign Secretary has been doing a lot

366
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:56,820
of work with other Foreign Ministers on this
issue. We provide significant support to Ukraine,

367
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,370
and I hope to be able to meet President Poroshenko
soon and talk about the support we provide.

368
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,670
>>Mr Pat McFadden (Wolverhampton South East)
(Lab): In her speech last week, the Prime

369
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,300
Minister said that Parliament would get a
vote on the final deal between the UK and

370
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,429
the European Union. Will she set out for the
House what would happen if Parliament said

371
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:24,850
no to the terms of that deal? In those circumstances,
would she negotiate an alternative deal, or

372
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:31,360
would her no deal option mean our falling
back on World Trade Organisation rules, which

373
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,220
would mean 10% tariffs on cars, 20% tariffs
on food and drink, and a host of other barriers

374
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,460
to trade, investment and prosperity in the
UK?

375
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,530
>>The Prime Minister: As I also said in my
speech last week, I expect that we will be

376
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:52,840
able to negotiate a good trade deal with the
European Union, because it will be in our

377
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,730
interests and the interests of the European
Union to do so. There will be a vote on the

378
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:04,050
deal for this Parliament. If this Parliament
is not willing to accept a deal that has been

379
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,520
decided on and agreed by the United Kingdom
Government with the European Union, then,

380
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,179
as I have said, we will have to fall back
on other arrangements.

381
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,551
>>Graham Evans (Weaver Vale) (Con): It was
a great pleasure to welcome my right hon.

382
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:22,380
Friend the Prime Minister and her Cabinet
to Sci-Tech Daresbury earlier this week. I

383
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,330
welcome the Government’s industrial strategy,
which will bring high-skill, high-wage jobs

384
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,470
that will help close the north-south divide.
The message is that Britain is open for business.

385
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:39,220
>>The Prime Minister: I and the whole Cabinet
were very pleased to be able to visit Daresbury.

386
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,950
I was pleased to sit down and meet small businesses
on that particular site and to hear their

387
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,940
support for what the Government are doing
in the industrial strategy. We should be very

388
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,390
clear that Britain is open for business. We
will be out there trading around the world.

389
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,940
We will be a global leader in free trade,
bringing jobs, economic growth and prosperity

390
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,300
to every part of this country.

391
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,809
>>Ian Blackford (Ross, Skye and Lochaber)
(SNP): We are all aware of the hundreds of

392
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,720
thousands of women around the world who marched
on behalf of women’s rights last weekend.

393
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,539
In this House, we have been lobbied by members
of the Women Against State Pension Inequality.

394
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,530
Many MPs have lodged petitions asking the
Government to act. Can the Prime Minister

395
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,909
tell us how many MPs have lodged such petitions?

396
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:31,829
>>The Prime Minister: I think the number of
petitions presented in this Parliament is

397
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:36,249
a matter for the House authorities. The hon.
Gentleman also knows that the Government have

398
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:41,189
already taken action in relation to the issue
of women’s pensions by reducing the changes

399
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,019
that will be experienced by women and putting
extra money into that.

400
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:49,618
>>Mr John Baron (Basildon and Billericay)
(Con): Following her excellent EU speech last

401
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,649
week, will the Prime Minister consider unilaterally
guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens living

402
00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:01,500
and working in the UK? Not only is that the
decent thing to do, but, by taking the moral

403
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,230
high ground, it will be a source of strength
going forward in the negotiations. We can

404
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,299
always return to the issue of non-reciprocation
by the EU, if necessary, later in those negotiations.

405
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:17,650
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the concern
that my hon. Friend has raised, but my position

406
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,050
remains the same as it always has been. I
expect, intend and want to be able to guarantee

407
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,220
the rights of EU citizens living here in the
United Kingdom, but, as the British Prime

408
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,559
Minister, it is only right that I should give
consideration to the rights of UK citizens

409
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:37,960
living elsewhere in what will be the remaining
27 member states of the EU. That is why I

410
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,640
want that reciprocal arrangement, but, as
I said in my speech last week, I remain open

411
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,490
to this being an issue that we negotiate at
a very early stage in the negotiations. There

412
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,819
are a good number of other European member
states that want that too. Some do not, but

413
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:55,040
I am hoping to settle this at an early stage.

414
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,270
>>Dr Lisa Cameron (East Kilbride, Strathaven
and Lesmahagow) (SNP): As chair of the all-party

415
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,510
parliamentary group on disability, we recently
compiled an important inquiry report into

416
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,460
the Government’s pledge to halve the disability
employment gap. Research shows that that pledge

417
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,519
will not be met for 50 years. To date, no
Minister has met the APPG to discuss the report.

418
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:23,480
Will the Prime Minister place people with
disability at the heart of policy and ensure

419
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,289
that her Ministers engage with the APPG and
its recommendations?

420
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:33,680
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady raises
an important issue about disabled people in

421
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:41,259
the workplace. It is one of which we are aware.
Of course, as we see unemployment going down,

422
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:46,869
the ratios do change to an extent. The Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions is looking

423
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:54,849
very seriously at how we can ensure that there
are more disabled people in the workplace.

424
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,750
I am sure that he will see the requests that
she has made in relation to the APPG.

425
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,810
>>Mr David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):
May I welcome the Prime Minister’s meeting

426
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,999
with the President of Turkey on Saturday,
when we can show our solidarity in the fight

427
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:14,450
against terrorism and deepen our trading relationship?
Will she also seek support for a united and

428
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,240
independent Cyprus, free from Turkish troops?

429
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,579
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising that matter. There are important

430
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,079
issues that I will be discussing with President
Erdoğan and with the Prime Minister of Turkey

431
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,619
when I meet them on Saturday. On Cyprus, I
am hopeful that the talks will continue and

432
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,880
that we will come to a solution—we are closer
to a solution now than we have been before.

433
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,150
I have already spoken to Prime Minister Tsipras
and to President Erdoğan about the need to

434
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,130
ensure that we are creative in the thinking
and in the finding of a solution. I had a

435
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,360
further telephone call with Nicos Anastasiades
over the weekend about this very issue. We

436
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:59,150
stand ready as a guarantor to play our part
in ensuring that we see a successful conclusion

437
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,739
of these talks and the reunification of Cyprus
that people have been working towards for

438
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,739
some time.

439
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:11,700
>>Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP): I
join the Prime Minister in wishing a speedy

440
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,589
recovery to the police officer who was shot
and injured in my constituency in north Belfast

441
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:23,460
on Sunday night. Thankfully, he was not killed—but
of course that was not the terrorists’ intention.

442
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,599
It is clear that the political instability
brought about by Sinn Féin’s collapse of

443
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,249
the Assembly is not in anyone’s interests
in Northern Ireland. It is also clear that

444
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:37,050
it is Sinn Féin’s intention to try to rewrite
the history of the past. Will the Prime Minister

445
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:43,130
make it very clear that the one-sided legal
persecution of police officers and soldiers

446
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,530
who did so much to bring peace to Northern
Ireland will not be allowed to continue?

447
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:54,079
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
indicates, political stability in Northern

448
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,489
Ireland has been hard earned over some considerable
time, and none of us wants to see that thrown

449
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:04,960
away. He raised the issue of the current situation
with a number of investigations by the Police

450
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,549
Service of Northern Ireland into former soldiers
and their activities in Northern Ireland.

451
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:13,670
It is absolutely right that we recognise that
the majority of people who lost their life

452
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,819
did so as a result of terrorist activity,
and it is important that that terrorist activity

453
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,869
is looked into. That is why one of the issues
that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of

454
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:27,789
State for Northern Ireland is looking at is
the legacy question and how the issue of investigation

455
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,430
on all sides can take place in future.

456
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:38,310
>>Maggie Throup (Erewash) (Con): Social care
provided by Labour-led Derbyshire County Council

457
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:45,619
is failing miserably, with serious errors
in process leading to shameful consequences

458
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:50,299
for some of the most vulnerable people in
my constituency. It is clearly not about funding,

459
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:57,030
as the council sits on reserves of about £233
million. Will my right hon. Friend instigate

460
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,390
an urgent review of social care practice at
the county council, because the people of

461
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,900
Derbyshire deserve better?

462
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,720
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend makes
an important point. The success of social

463
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,890
care is not wholly about funding. It is about
practice on the ground, which is why we have

464
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,470
made it clear that it is important to see
integration between social and health care

465
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:27,700
at a local level, and local authorities should
play their part in delivering that. This is

466
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,490
an issue that needs to be addressed for the
longer term as well. It has been ducked by

467
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,720
Governments for too long in this country,
which is why this Government are determined

468
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,930
to introduce a sustainable programme for social
care in future.

469
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,069
[Interruption.]

470
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:53,420
>>Mr Speaker: The right hon. Gentleman never
knew he was quite that popular.

471
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:01,630
>>Edward Miliband (Doncaster North) (Lab):
I was going to say, Mr Speaker, that it brings

472
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,630
back memories.

473
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,829
As the first foreign leader to meet President
Trump, the Prime Minister carries a huge responsibility

474
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:10,809
on behalf not just of this country but of
the whole international community in the tone

475
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:16,869
that she sets. Can I ask her to reassure us
that she will say to the President that he

476
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:23,380
must abide by, and not withdraw from, the
Paris climate change treaty? In case it is

477
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,329
helpful, can she offer the services of UK
scientists to convince the President that

478
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:32,319
climate change is not a hoax invented by the
Chinese?

479
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,729
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the role
that the right hon. Gentleman has played in

480
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:42,349
looking at the issue of climate change, and
I hope that he recognises the commitment that

481
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:47,609
the Government have shown to this issue, with
the legislation that we have introduced and

482
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:52,539
the changes that we have brought about in
the energy sector and the use of different

483
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,769
forms of energy. The Obama Administration
signed up to the Paris climate change agreement,

484
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:04,390
and we have now done so. I would hope that
all parties would continue to ensure that

485
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,249
that climate change agreement is put into
practice.
