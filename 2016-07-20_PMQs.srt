1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,949
>>John Glen (Salisbury) (Con): If she will
list her official engagements for Wednesday

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:02,190
20 July.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:20,580
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that the whole House will wish to

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,699
join me in welcoming today’s employment
figures, which show employment at another

5
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:33,739
record high, the lowest unemployment rate
in over a decade and wages rising.

6
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,129
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others, and in addition to

7
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,829
my duties in this House I shall have further
such meetings later today. This afternoon,

8
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,999
I will travel to Berlin to meet Chancellor
Merkel to discuss how we implement the decision

9
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:51,379
that the British people took in the referendum,
and I expect we will also cover a number of

10
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,739
other pressing international issues. Tomorrow,
I will visit Paris for similar discussions

11
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,229
with President Hollande.

12
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:09,829
>>John Glen: I warmly welcome the Prime Minister
to her place. Given her unwavering commitment

13
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:18,100
to delivering economic stability and national
security in our United Kingdom’s interest,

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,789
does she welcome Monday’s emphatic vote
in this House for the Trident Successor programme,

15
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:32,679
and will she ensure that economic stability
and national security remain the guiding principles

16
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,810
of her premiership?

17
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:43,880
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for his kind remarks. I join him in enthusiastically

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,810
welcoming the vote taken in this House on
Monday evening to renew our nuclear deterrent.

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,929
I think that vote showed the commitment of
this House: it showed that we have not only

20
00:01:54,929 --> 00:02:00,289
committed to our own national security, but
considered the security of European and NATO

21
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:06,670
allies. We can now get on with the essential
job of renewing our nuclear deterrent. May

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:16,650
I thank the 140 Labour Members of Parliament
who put the national interest first and voted

23
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,640
to renew the nuclear deterrent?

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,879
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): May
I welcome the right hon. Lady to her first

25
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,180
Prime Minister’s Question Time, and congratulate
her on her appointment and on becoming the

26
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,340
country’s second woman Prime Minister? I
hope that she will agree with me that Prime

27
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,450
Minister’s Question Time in this House should
be an opportunity to debate seriously the

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,760
issues that face our country and our place
in the world.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,250
On the steps of Downing Street, the Prime
Minister talked very eloquently about “fighting…burning

30
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:59,019
injustice”; yet her last act as Home Secretary
was to shunt the Orgreave inquiry into the

31
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,340
long grass. The Advocate General told the
House of Lords:

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,590
“The IPCC told Home Office officials that
if it announced any action to set up an inquiry

33
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,620
or other investigation relating to Orgreave,
it would have an impact on the Hillsborough

34
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,920
investigation.”

35
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,189
The Independent Police Complaints Commission
disputes that account. I hope Parliament was

36
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:25,739
not misled. Will the Prime Minister now proceed
with a full public inquiry into the terrible

37
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,170
events at Orgreave?

38
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:35,420
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for the welcome he has given me.

39
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,090
He referred to me as the second woman Prime
Minister. In my years in the House, I have

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,010
long heard the Labour party asking what the
Conservative party does for women. Well—it

41
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:55,040
just keeps making us Prime Minister.

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,489
I welcome the comments the right hon. Gentleman
made about Prime Minister’s questions. We

43
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,549
do debate serious issues at Prime Minister’s
questions. I look forward to the exchanges

44
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,219
he and I will have, and I hope that we will
be having those exchanges over the Dispatch

45
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:15,159
Box for many years to come.

46
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,790
As regards the Orgreave inquiry, I think the
shadow Home Secretary has an urgent question

47
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,850
on that this afternoon, to which the Home
Secretary will be responding.

48
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,740
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The new Prime Minister also
said on the steps of Downing Street:

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,580
“If you’re young, you’ll find it harder
than ever before to own your own home.”

50
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,000
In 1998, more than half of working households
of people aged 16 to 34 were buying their

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,570
own homes. Today, the figure is 25% and the
Resolution Foundation suggests it will fall

52
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,560
to 10% in the next nine years. What figure
has the Prime Minister set herself for home

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,470
ownership among young people?

54
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,200
>>The Prime Minister: I notice the timeline
that the right hon. Gentleman referred to.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,940
He might have forgotten that during that period
we had 13 years of a Labour Government—a

56
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,270
Labour Government who had a very bad record
on house building. It is this Government who

57
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,040
will change that and this Government who are
putting more into building more homes to ensure

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,380
that young people have a better opportunity
to get on the housing ladder. That is why

59
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,300
we are a Government who will govern for everyone
in this country.

60
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,910
>>Jeremy Corbyn: That Labour Government put
a decent homes standard in place in every

61
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:47,840
part of this country. I am not sure that—[Interruption.]
I am not sure that starter homes at £450,000

62
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,460
for young people earning 7% less than their
parents’ generation represent a good prospect

63
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,800
for people owning their own homes.

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,280
The Prime Minister is rightly concerned that:

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,300
“If you’re black, you’re treated more
harshly…than if you’re white.”

66
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,930
Before appointing her new Foreign Secretary,
did she discuss with him his description of

67
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,180
black people as “piccaninnies” and ask
why he had questioned the motives of US President

68
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,200
Obama on the basis of his “part-Kenyan”
heritage?

69
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:27,740
>>The Prime Minister: The 
right hon. Gentleman started his question
by making reference to the issue of starter

70
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,480
homes and the upper limit in London of £450,000.
I have sat on these Benches and heard him

71
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,440
raise that with my right hon. Friend the Member
for Witney (Mr Cameron) on a number of occasions

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,680
when he was Prime Minister. Can I just explain
this to the Leader of the Opposition? If he

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,180
looks at house prices across the country,
he will see that they vary. In Liverpool,

74
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,800
the average house price is just over £116,000.
In London, the average house price is just

75
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:00,410
over £676,000. That is why we have a higher
limit for starter homes in London. If he objects

76
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,240
to that, he needs to tell his constituents
why he is against their having opportunities

77
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,440
to get on the housing ladder.

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the remarks
I made. It is correct that if you are black,

79
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,550
you will be treated more harshly in the criminal
justice system. That is exactly why, as Home

80
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,360
Secretary, I dealt with the issue of stop
and search. I was concerned to make sure that

81
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,080
nobody should be stopped and searched on the
streets of this country because of the colour

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,750
of their skin. I did that as a Conservative;
in 13 years, Labour did nothing on it.

83
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:44,220
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was actually
about the language used by the Foreign Secretary.

84
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,800
Earlier this week, the new Chancellor abandoned
the Government’s budget surplus target,

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,670
which Labour has long called for. The Prime
Minister’s Government are already missing

86
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:02,110
their targets on debt, the deficit, the welfare
cap and productivity. Six years of Government

87
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:10,560
austerity have failed. The long-term economic
plan is clearly dead. Is there a new one?

88
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,810
>>The Prime Minister: It is the long-term
economic plan that has delivered the record

89
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:24,020
level of employment that we see today. Perhaps
I could put the right hon. Gentleman straight.

90
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,470
We have not abandoned the intention to move
to a surplus. What I have said is that we

91
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:37,129
will not target that at the end of this Parliament.
He uses the language of austerity; I call

92
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:49,339
it living within our means. He talks about
austerity, but actually it is about not saddling

93
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:55,540
our children and grandchildren with significant
debts in the years to come. It is not about

94
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,300
austerity; it is about ensuring that we have
an economy that works for everyone.

95
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,319
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Jobless claims have risen
for the fourth month in a row and welfare

96
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:11,959
claims have risen as well. Austerity actually
means people being poorer, services being

97
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,430
cut and local facilities being closed. In
her speech on the steps of Downing Street

98
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,160
the Prime Minister also addressed insecure
workers, saying:

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,170
“You have a job but you don’t always have
job security.”

100
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:33,850
Does that mean that those people who are worried
about their future in work—[Interruption.]

101
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:44,120
I am talking of the people who sent us here
to serve them. Does that mean that she is

102
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,610
proposing to scrap employment tribunal fees,
repeal the Trade Union Act 2016 and ban zero-hours

103
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,420
contracts, as more than a dozen European nations
have done already? That would help to give

104
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,569
greater job security to many very worried
people in this country.

105
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:05,620
>>The Prime Minister: Again, i say to the
right hon. Gentleman that yes, I said that

106
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,100
on the steps of Downing Street, because it
is very important that here in this House

107
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,639
we consider not only what might be called
the more obvious injustices, but life for

108
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,720
those people who are in work and struggling
to make ends meet. That is essential, and

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,269
the Government have raised the threshold at
which people start to pay income tax, for

110
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:34,279
example. It is also about making sure that
we have more well-paid jobs in this country,

111
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,959
which the Government are also doing.

112
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,310
I am interested that the right hon. Gentleman
referred to the situation of some workers

113
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:50,410
who might have job insecurity and potentially
unscrupulous bosses. I suspect that many Members

114
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,259
on the Opposition Benches might be familiar
with an unscrupulous boss—a boss who does

115
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:04,420
not listen to his workers, a boss who requires
some of his workers to double their workload

116
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:24,230
and maybe even a boss who exploits the rules
to further his own career. Remind him of anybody?

117
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:36,930
>>Jeremy Corbyn: We are sent here to represent
people. Many people in this country are struggling

118
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,839
with low wages and insecure jobs—[Hon. Members:
“You!”] I know this is very funny for

119
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:50,629
all the Conservative Members, but I do not
suppose there are too many Conservative MPs

120
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:56,949
who have to go to a food bank to supplement
the food on their family’s table every week.

121
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,740
We should reflect on that.

122
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,379
The Prime Minister highlighted the failures
of her predecessor on social justice, home

123
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:10,499
ownership, education and the cost of living.
Some might say that, as a Cabinet Minister,

124
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:14,980
she too was responsible for those. She empathised
with working people, saying:

125
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,040
“I know you’re working around the clock,
I know you’re doing your best, and I know

126
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,240
that sometimes life can be a struggle.”

127
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,629
Yesterday a report from the Institute for
Fiscal Studies found that two thirds of children

128
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:33,249
living in poverty in Britain have at least
one parent in work. What, other than warm

129
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:38,809
words, is she going to offer those families
and those children, who are often hungry and

130
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:44,410
very insecure in their way of living? Is it
not our duty to offer some hope and security

131
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,689
to them?

132
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:53,990
>>The Prime Minister: Yes it is, and we are
concerned about those people, but the answer

133
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,459
is not the Labour party’s unlimited, uncapped
welfare for people. The answer for people

134
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:05,749
who are in work and struggling and for those
who want to get into work is to have a strong

135
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:13,550
economy that delivers jobs, and well-paid
jobs in particular. I assure the right hon.

136
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,139
Gentleman that on the Government Benches we
are focused on building a country that works

137
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:23,559
for everyone. That means an economy that ensures
that everyone can benefit from the nation’s

138
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,899
wealth, a society where everyone gets the
opportunities they deserve and a democracy

139
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,660
that everyone can have faith in.

140
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,110
Finally, I say to the right hon. Gentleman
that the Labour party may be about to spend

141
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,009
several months fighting and tearing itself
apart; the Conservative party will be spending

142
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,610
those months bringing this country back together.

143
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,110
>>MPs: More!

144
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:54,329
>>Mr Speaker: There will be more. I call Sir
Edward Leigh.

145
00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:07,959
>>Sir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con): I
agree with the Prime Minister. [Hon. Members:

146
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:19,139
“Hear, hear!”] We are leaving the EU and
we are going to make a success of it, so will

147
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:25,740
she make my day special by saying that she
is prepared to reject staying in the single

148
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,600
regulated market and to offer instead to our
friends in Europe a free trade deal that is

149
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,470
very much in their interests? Let us take
back control.

150
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,399
>>MPs: Hear, hear!

151
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,660
>>The Prime Minister: I am tempted to say
that I probably ought to sit down and enjoy

152
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,769
that for the rest of the day. My hon. Friend
has made my day, and I hope that I can make

153
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:57,709
his day by wishing him a very happy birthday.
I assure him that as we look at the result

154
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,839
of the referendum, I am very clear that Brexit
does mean Brexit, and as he says, we will

155
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,559
make a success of it. In negotiating the deal,
we need to ensure that we listen to what people

156
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,699
have said about the need for controls on free
movement, and that we also negotiate the right

157
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,559
and best deal for trade in goods and services
for the British people.

158
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:27,059
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): May I extend
my congratulations to the Prime Minister on

159
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:32,459
her first outing at Prime Minister’s questions,
ahead of her travels to Berlin? The German

160
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:38,689
Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, has already
confirmed how Scotland is able to remain in

161
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:46,029
the European Union. Did the Prime Minister
discuss that when she met First Minister Nicola

162
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:53,999
Sturgeon in Edinburgh, and will she do everything
to ensure that remain means remain for Scotland?

163
00:15:53,999 --> 00:16:01,309
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his welcome, for his comments

164
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:07,360
in Monday’s debate, and for his recognition
of support for my husband Philip. As the right

165
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,410
hon. Gentleman said, we all rely on support
from those around us to do our jobs, and we

166
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,879
should never forget that. I did discuss arrangements
in relation to the negotiations for the United

167
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,459
Kingdom leaving the EU with the First Minister,
and I was very pleased that my first trip

168
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,639
was a trip to Scotland and that I was able
to do that so early in my premiership. As

169
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,970
I have been clear, the Union is very important
to me. I was also clear with the First Minister

170
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,339
that I think that some of the ideas being
put forward are impracticable, but I am willing

171
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,869
to listen to options that are brought forward,
and we will be engaging fully with all the

172
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,800
devolved Administrations.

173
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,410
>>Angus Robertson: Germany has the highest
level of support of any continental European

174
00:16:50,410 --> 00:17:00,800
country for Scotland remaining in the European
Union. Will the Prime Minister thank Chancellor

175
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,010
Merkel for the interest of the members of
her Government and of the Bundestag in having

176
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:15,390
Scotland remain within the EU? Will she assure
the Chancellor and other Heads of State and

177
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:23,640
Government that we in Scotland will do everything—everything—that
is necessary for us to remain in the EU?

178
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,630
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
has taken that line for some time—he took

179
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,640
it with my predecessor—but I find it a little
confusing, given that only two years ago in

180
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,880
the Scottish referendum, the Scottish National
party was campaigning for Scotland to leave

181
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,560
the United Kingdom, which would have meant
leaving the European Union.

182
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:54,860
>>Daniel Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham)
(Con): We all stand with the people of France,

183
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,500
and particularly Nice, following the appalling
terrorist act there last week. Will the Prime

184
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,990
Minister update the House on how the security
collaboration between our two countries can

185
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,250
help to prevent such attacks in future, and
will she reassure the French people that although

186
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,120
we are leaving the European Union, the close
links between our two countries will remain

187
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,650
steadfast?

188
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,240
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important topic, and as has been said in

189
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,650
this House before, our thoughts are with all
the people of France after the appalling attack

190
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,910
that took place in Nice last week. We continue
to work with the French authorities in the

191
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,160
aftermath of that attack, and my hon. Friend
is right to say that we must continue our

192
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,910
security co-operation with France and other
European countries. We will not be cowed by

193
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,140
terrorists; we both face the same threats,
and we need to work together to defeat those

194
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,900
threats. I absolutely confirm that, yes, the
United Kingdom will leave the European Union,

195
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,340
but the United Kingdom is not leaving Europe
and our co-operation will continue.

196
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,440
>>Mr Jamie Reed (Copeland) (Lab): I welcome
the Prime Minister to her place and I wish

197
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,750
her well in healing the country in the months
and years to come—after all, it is she and

198
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:24,890
her colleagues who so bitterly divided it.
I also thank her for her wholehearted support

199
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,380
for and endorsement of official Labour party
policy on Trident. It is such a refreshing

200
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:44,030
change to hear that from the Dispatch Box.
As a type 1 diabetic and a father and uncle

201
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:49,670
to children with type 1 diabetes, and on behalf
of 500,000 people in this country, 30,000

202
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,540
of them children, may I thank the Prime Minister
for the example she has shown in demonstrating

203
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,690
without doubt that diabetes does not hold
us back in any way whatsoever? There is no

204
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:06,610
doubt that the Prime Minister’s predecessor
left the NHS in a much worse condition than

205
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:16,290
he found it. Will the Prime Minister visit
West Cumberland hospital in my constituency,

206
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:21,370
honour the promises made by the previous Prime
Minister, and stop her Government cutting

207
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,480
services there further?

208
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:33,430
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman refers
to divisions on the Conservative Benches.

209
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:39,420
I have to say: which party was it that took
three weeks to decide who its unity candidate

210
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,610
should be? It is the Labour party that is
divided.

211
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,200
I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks
on type 1 diabetes. There are many youngsters

212
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,070
out there, from tiny tots to teenagers, living
with type 1 diabetes. It is important that

213
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,070
we send a message to them that their future
is not limited: they can do whatever they

214
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,450
want.

215
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,620
The hon. Gentleman is the first hon. Member
at Prime Minister’s questions to invite

216
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,730
me to his constituency. I will, of course,
look very closely at all invitations I receive.

217
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,750
It is important that decisions about the construct
of local NHS services are taken at a local

218
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,760
level by the NHS. He made a point about the
agreement in the official policy of the Conservative

219
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,410
party and the Labour party on Trident. I simply
remind him that where we did disagree at the

220
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,760
election was that the Conservative party agreed
to put in the money that was necessary for

221
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,710
the NHS. The Labour party refused to commit
to that.

222
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,040
>>Nusrat Ghani (Wealden) (Con): Extremism
takes many forms, from the atrocity in Nice

223
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,780
to the violent murder of Qandeel Baloch by
her own brother in Pakistan. That murder was

224
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,670
justified as an “honour killing”. There
have been 11,000 incidents of self-styled

225
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,130
honour crimes in the UK in the past five years.
Does the Prime Minister agree that such crimes

226
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,160
are in fact acts of terror, not honour? Will
she therefore direct her new Government to

227
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,150
choose to lead and end the use of the word
“honour” to describe these vile acts in

228
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,030
order to stop giving any legitimacy to the
idea that women are the property of men?

229
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,140
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a very important issue, one that I think resonates

230
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,370
across the whole House. She is absolutely
right: extremism does take many forms. That

231
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,350
is why, in the Government’s counter-extremism
strategy, we are looking very widely across

232
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:33,670
the breadth of issues of extremism, including
tackling the root causes of some practices

233
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:39,440
within communities, such as so-called honour-based
violence. I absolutely agree with her that

234
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,000
there is absolutely no honour in so-called
honour-based violence. It is violence and

235
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,170
a criminal act, pure and simple.

236
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:55,060
>>Julie Cooper (Burnley) (Lab): I, too, welcome
the Prime Minister to her first Prime Minister’s

237
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:02,840
Question Time. Will she listen to the headteachers
of the excellent primary schools in my constituency?

238
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,440
They tell me that the recent unprecedented
changes to primary education, including the

239
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,210
new SATs, have led to negative impacts on
children’s learning outcomes. Will she urge

240
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,500
the new Secretary of State to take those concerns
forward, listen and make useful changes?

241
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:30,010
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the hon. Lady
for her welcome. Getting education right is

242
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,690
absolutely crucial if we are to ensure that
people can take up the opportunities they

243
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,350
deserve and have the aspiration to take up
those opportunities. Obviously, my right hon.

244
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,760
Friend the new Education Secretary will be
looking across the board at the education

245
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,390
provision that is in place. We have made some
important changes already over the past six

246
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,040
years that are improving the quality of education
and mean that more children are receiving

247
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,070
the quality of education they need. There
is, of course, more for us to do and we will

248
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,340
be looking to do that.

249
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:04,170
>>Andrew Stephenson (Pendle) (Con): In my
constituency, aerospace is of vital importance,

250
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,380
with Rolls-Royce employing more than 1,000
people at sites in Barnoldswick. Aerospace

251
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,670
is important not just to Pendle, however,
but to the whole UK economy, so will the Prime

252
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,390
Minister congratulate all the companies that
attended the Farnborough airshow last week

253
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,160
on the deals they signed, and does she agree
that the nearly £100 billion of trade deals

254
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,020
already done this year demonstrates that Britain
is very much still open for business?

255
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,850
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right that Britain is open for business, and

256
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,780
I know what an important role the aerospace
industry plays in his constituency, as he

257
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,250
pointed out with his reference to Rolls-Royce,
and in constituencies across the country.

258
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,390
I also know of the importance of the Farnborough
airshow. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot

259
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,700
(Sir Gerald Howarth) was telling me last night
what a great airshow it was. The Government

260
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,740
committed at Farnborough to providing a new
£365 million fund for research and development

261
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,850
to ensure we retain our leading position in
the sector. As my hon. Friend also said, a

262
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,740
significant number of trade deals have already
been signed, which shows that Britain is open

263
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,560
for business. I would encourage other companies
to go out there and get that business.

264
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,270
>>Catherine McKinnell (Newcastle upon Tyne
North) (Lab): I, too, welcome the right hon.

265
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,820
Lady to her place. Newcastle airport was voted
“best in Britain” this week, but the good

266
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,790
news that it is really waiting for is a decision
on Heathrow expansion. The Prime Minister

267
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,940
knows that Britain needs to be open for business,
so will she do better than dithering Dave

268
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,840
and give us a decision without delay?

269
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,040
>>The Prime Minister: I have fond memories
of Newcastle airport, from the time when I

270
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,580
stood in the North West Durham constituency
some years ago and made quite good use of

271
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,910
the airport. It has changed and expanded rather
since then. Our position on Heathrow has not

272
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,730
changed. Obviously, there was the Howard Davies
review, and further work has been done on

273
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:57,170
the question of air quality around the proposals
put forward. The Cabinet and the Government

274
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,780
will take a decision, in the proper way, in
due course.

275
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:08,760
>>Kelly Tolhurst (Rochester and Strood) (Con):
Based on an analysis of the crime survey for

276
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,660
England and Wales by the Children’s Society,
it is estimated that 113 16 and 17-year-old

277
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:21,410
girls in my constituency experienced a sexual
offence in the past year. Given the progress

278
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:27,330
made in tackling child sexual exploitation
in the last few years, will my right hon.

279
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,370
Friend outline whether the Government have
plans to strengthen the protection for this

280
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,460
particular vulnerable age group?

281
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:40,070
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a very important issue. We have seen recently

282
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,570
the appalling circumstances in Rotherham in
relation to child sexual exploitation, but

283
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,290
as she has shown, in every constituency in
the country, young people are being subjected

284
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,620
to sexual offences of various sorts. That
is why, since Rotherham, the Government have

285
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,630
been working with all the appropriate agencies
to ensure we put greater support in place.

286
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,470
We have provided an extra £7 million of funding
to ensure that victims of sexual abuse receive

287
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,850
the right support, launched the whistleblowing
helpline to help authorities spot patterns

288
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,600
of failure, and made child sexual abuse and
exploitation a national threat, meaning that

289
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,330
police authorities have a duty to collaborate
on this terrible crime. In the coming months,

290
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,140
we will also be strengthening our arrangements.
We are all appalled by child sexual abuse,

291
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,470
and we need to carry on making sure that we
eradicate it.

292
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,340
>>Imran Hussain (Bradford East) (Lab): In
her first statement from the steps of Downing

293
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,700
Street, the Prime Minister stated that she
would lead a Government who would work for

294
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,040
everyone. Since she became Prime Minister,
I have tried unsuccessfully to get assurances

295
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,950
on the continuation of the northern schools
strategy and the £80 million set aside for

296
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:03,380
it. Will she give me that commitment today
so that children in Bradford and the north

297
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,630
can have the same chances as those in London
and the south?

298
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,970
>>The Prime Minister: It is important that
we ensure that children across the country

299
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,000
get the opportunities they deserve, and the
quality of education they receive is an important

300
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,960
part of that. The review launched in March
by Sir Nick Weller will make recommendations

301
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,400
to address this particular issue. I assure
the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend

302
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,780
the Education Secretary will look carefully
at the result of that review and, in due course,

303
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:41,750
make clear the Government’s response to
its recommendations.

304
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:50,950
>>Stuart Andrew (Pudsey) (Con): Growing up
on a council estate, I found it tough coming

305
00:28:50,950 --> 00:29:03,480
out—as a Conservative. Difficult as it was,
I understood then, as I do now, that it is

306
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,850
only Conservative Governments that deliver
real social mobility. Does my right hon. Friend

307
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,440
agree that it is the Government’s job to
fight for such opportunities for the people

308
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,220
of Britain, because the Labour party are too
busy fighting each other?

309
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,300
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend puts
it very well. If we look at the Conservative

310
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,750
Benches, we see, as he said, Conservative
Members of Parliament who were brought up

311
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,940
in council houses and Conservative MPs brought
up by single parent families, while the chairman

312
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,340
of the Conservative party is a former miner.
It is this party that is looking at opportunity

313
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:48,990
for all. I am certainly very clear that the
Government I lead will be driven not by the

314
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,510
interests of the privileged few, but by the
interests of everyone in this country. We

315
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,740
are not entrenching the advantages of the
privileged few in terms of opportunity, but

316
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,690
extending opportunity to all.

317
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:06,000
>>Stuart Blair Donaldson (West Aberdeenshire
and Kincardine) (SNP): Whatever one’s politics,

318
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,470
one cannot help but be inspired by last week’s
image of the female Prime Minister of the

319
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,410
UK meeting the female First Minister of Scotland.
It sends a message to girls everywhere that

320
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,580
they can achieve anything they want, and nothing
should be off limits to them. Does the Prime

321
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,010
Minister agree that to do this, girls and
women should be able to live free from gender-based

322
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,750
violence and domestic abuse, and will she
commit to supporting the Bill of my hon. Friend

323
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,930
the Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)
and ratify the Istanbul convention?

324
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:40,350
>>The Prime Minister: It is an important symbol
for girls and young women when they can see

325
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,320
women in positions such as Prime Minister
and First Minister of Scotland. I respect

326
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,070
the First Minister; we had a very constructive
first meeting. There were certain issues on

327
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,520
which we disagree and will continue to disagree,
but we will work practically and pragmatically

328
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,100
together.

329
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,090
It is important to deal with the issues of
gender violence and domestic violence against

330
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,450
women and girls. That is why the Government
have—I led this as Home Secretary—a strategy

331
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,730
to deal with violence against women and girls,
which is now being taken on by my right hon.

332
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,900
Friend the new Home Secretary. We have a good
record on what we have done, for example,

333
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,330
putting into operation domestic violence protection
orders and the new coercive control offence,

334
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,370
but there is always more to do and we will
be doing that.

335
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:29,400
>>Simon Hoare (North Dorset) (Con): I welcome
my right hon. Friend to her place, and if

336
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:40,800
it is not too untoward to say, I declare it
as game, set and match to her this afternoon.

337
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,740
Last week, when I met local National Farmers
Union representatives in North Dorset, they

338
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,290
understood precisely what we were doing in
delivering on Brexit, but were keen to ensure

339
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,740
that the needs of agriculture and British
farmers are front and centre in those discussions

340
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,220
and that their interests are not neglected.
May I invite my right hon. Friend to make

341
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,230
that commitment today?

342
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,760
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to make
the commitment that, as we look at the position

343
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,450
we will take in the negotiations for the UK
to leave the European Union, we will consult

344
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:20,000
widely. I recognise that agriculture is a
sector that is particularly affected by Brexit,

345
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,140
and I can assure my hon. Friend that we will
consult and listen to the views of farmers

346
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,220
and others involved in the food industry and
agricultural sector.

347
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,870
>>Mr Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):
I congratulate the right hon. Lady on becoming

348
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,260
Prime Minister, and gently remind her of the
conversation we had a few weeks ago when I

349
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,350
said she was going to come through the middle
and trounce the men standing for that position.

350
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:52,140
I was right. I also said I was going to put
some money on her, but I never got round to

351
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,940
it—unfortunately, because the odds were
very good at the time.

352
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,070
May I ask the Prime Minister a serious question
about the younger generation, the millennials?

353
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,750
So many of them in our country believe that
they are citizens of Europe who have the ability

354
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:14,240
to travel, to work and to be true Europeans.
Will she soon give them her vision of how

355
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,310
that reality as European citizens can be delivered
even in the present circumstances?

356
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,480
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the hon. Gentleman,
and I do indeed remember the conversation

357
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,900
in which he said that I would, as he put it,
“trounce the men”. I have to say, however,

358
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:34,700
that the Conservative party came up with an
all-woman shortlist, without being required

359
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,970
to do so.

360
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:43,600
The hon. Gentleman raises an important point
about the younger generation. This is what

361
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,790
I would say to them today. As I said a little
earlier in response to my hon. Friend the

362
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:53,410
Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski),
we are leaving the European Union, but we

363
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,170
are not leaving Europe. Over the coming weeks
and months, we will be setting out our negotiating

364
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:05,000
position on the relationship with the European
Union when we leave. I would also say to the

365
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,929
young people that the hon. Gentleman talks
about that we should not limit their opportunities

366
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,809
and their horizons by just looking at Europe.
This country will make a success of Brexit,

367
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,970
because we will be out there in the world
as an outward-looking, expansive country,

368
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,848
with opportunities around the globe.

369
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:29,409
>>Philip Davies (Shipley) (Con): May I warmly
welcome the Prime Minister to her post? Unlike

370
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:36,549
dithering Barry, I did place a bet on her
becoming the next leader of our party. I apologise

371
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:41,950
for the fact that my phone was obviously turned
off when she was calling me to invite me to

372
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,818
join her Government.

373
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:51,609
The reason the people of Yorkshire voted overwhelmingly
to leave the European Union was largely to

374
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:57,079
do with immigration control. Can the Prime
Minister reassure them that when we finally

375
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:03,640
do leave the European Union, she will insist
on keeping her original promise to bring the

376
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,049
immigration figures down to the tens of thousands?

377
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:19,099
>>The Prime Minister: The vote that took place
on 23 June sent a very clear message about

378
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,140
immigration. It sent the clear message that
people want control of free movement from

379
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,740
the European Union, and that is precisely
what we will ensure that we get in the negotiations

380
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:34,650
that we will undertake. I also remain absolutely
firm in my belief that we need to bring net

381
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:41,720
migration down to sustainable levels, and
the Government believe that that means tens

382
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,859
of thousands. It will take some time to get
there, but now, of course, there is the added

383
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:52,319
aspect of the controls that we can bring in
relation to people moving from the European

384
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:52,539
Union.

385
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:56,279
>>Mr Speaker: Finally, I call Mr Tim Farron.
[Interruption.]

386
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:05,779
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
You are all very, very kind.

387
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:13,640
May I, genuinely, warmly welcome the Prime
Minister to her position? She has come a long

388
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,140
way since we were on the hustings together
in North West Durham, and she is no doubt

389
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:24,130
reflecting on the fact that she is receiving
more support in the Chamber than either of

390
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,319
us received in Consett working men’s club.

391
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:34,420
There are reports today that the new Brexit
unit will be hiring lawyers at a cost of £5,000

392
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:41,059
per head per day. May I ask whether the Prime
Minister will be using the mythical £350

393
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,619
million to pay the legal fees, or is that
still pencilled in for the NHS, as promised

394
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,920
by her Cabinet colleagues who campaigned for
Leave?

395
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,319
>>The Prime Minister: I think it absolutely
right for us to create a new Department to

396
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,880
focus on the work of negotiating the United
Kingdom’s departure from the United Kingdom,

397
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,759
and that Department will need the expertise
that will enable it to undertake the negotiations.

398
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:10,130
I am very happy to remember the days that
the hon. Gentleman and I spent campaigning

399
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,170
in North West Durham at the time of a general
election. Little did the voters of North West

400
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:20,369
Durham know that the two unsuccessful candidates
in that election would become leaders of two

401
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,289
of the country’s political parties, although
I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that

402
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:35,390
my party is a little bit bigger than his.
