1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:11,120
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May):
I am sure that Members across the House will

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,640
wish to join me in offering our condolences
to the families and friends of Andreea Christie,

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,109
who died following the London attack, and
of Chris Bevington, who was among those killed

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,839
in the terrorist attack in Sweden. Our thoughts
are also with the family and friends of Hannah

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,320
Bladon, who was murdered in Jerusalem last
week.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,460
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,300
in this House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,949
>> Alberto Costa:
I would also like to join the Prime Minister

9
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:50,100
in offering the condolences of the people
of South Leicestershire and myself to the

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,859
families of those individuals.

11
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:02,609
Strong countries need strong economies. Strong
countries need strong defences. Strong countries

12
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:15,770
need strong leaders. As the nation prepares
to go to the polls, who else in this House,

13
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:23,003
apart from my right hon. Friend, can provide
the leadership that is needed at this time?

14
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:34,920
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,020
are three things that a country needs: a strong
economy, strong defence, and strong, stable

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,700
leadership. That is what our plans for Brexit
and our plans for a stronger Britain will

17
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,280
deliver. That is what the Conservative party
will be offering at this election, and we

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,090
will be out there fighting for every vote.
The right hon. Member for Islington North

19
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,659
(Jeremy Corbyn) would bankrupt our economy
and weaken our defences and is simply not

20
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,210
fit to lead.

21
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:21,040
>> Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab):
I concur with the condolences that the Prime

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,280
Minister just sent to the families of the
three people who so sadly and needlessly died.

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,930
It is important that we recognise that as
a cross-party proposal today, and I thank

24
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,900
the Prime Minister for it.

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:48,140
We welcome the general election, but this
is a Prime Minister who promised that there

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:03:00,069
would not be one—a Prime Minister who cannot
be trusted. She says that it is about leadership,

27
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:12,900
yet she refuses to defend her record in television
debates. It is not hard to see why. The Prime

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:24,640
Minister says that we have a stronger economy,
yet she cannot explain why people’s wages

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:35,019
are lower today than they were 10 years ago
or why more households are in debt. Six million

30
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:42,950
people are earning less than the living wage,
child poverty is up, and pensioner poverty

31
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:54,579
is up. Why are so many people getting poorer?

32
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,629
>> The Prime Minister:
I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that

33
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,439
I have been answering his questions and debating
these matters every Wednesday that Parliament

34
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:13,720
has been sitting since I became Prime Minister.
I will be taking out to the country in this

35
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:23,290
campaign a proud record of a Conservative
Government: a stronger economy, with the deficit

36
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,510
nearly two thirds down, a tax cut for 30 million
people, with 4 million people taken out of

37
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,900
income tax altogether, record levels of employment,
and £1,250 more a year for pensioners. That

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,460
is a record we can proud of.

39
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,180
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
If the Prime Minister is so proud of her record,

40
00:04:48,180 --> 00:05:00,760
why will she not debate it? Wages are falling
and more children are in poverty. Page 28

41
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,640
of the Tories’ last manifesto said:

42
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,450
“We will work to eliminate child poverty”.

43
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,680
They only eliminated the child poverty target,
not child poverty. In 2010, they promised

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,340
to eradicate the deficit by 2015. In 2015,
they promised to eradicate the deficit by

45
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:31,030
2020. Austerity has failed, so does the Prime
Minister know by which year the deficit will

46
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:37,110
now be eradicated?

47
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,960
>> The Prime Minister:
I know that it has taken the right hon. Gentleman

48
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,570
a little time to get the hang of Prime Minister’s
questions, but he stands up week in, week

49
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:59,610
out and asks me questions and I respond to
those questions. With a stronger—[Interruption.]

50
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,960
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The Leader of the Opposition must be

51
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,900
heard, and the Prime Minister must be heard.

52
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,650
>> The Prime Minister:
We have a stronger economy, with the deficit

53
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,800
two thirds down, but people will have a real
choice at this election. They will have a

54
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,690
choice between a Conservative Government who
have shown that we can build a stronger economy

55
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,840
and a Labour party with an economic policy
that would bankrupt this country. What voters

56
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:36,250
know is that under Labour it is ordinary working
people who pay the price of the Labour party.

57
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,560
They pay it with their taxes, they pay it
with their jobs, and they pay it with their

58
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,630
children’s futures.

59
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,690
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Only this year the new Chancellor pledged

60
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:56,440
to eradicate the deficit by 2022. I admire
Tory consistency: it is always five years

61
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,560
in the future. Another Tory broken promise.

62
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,870
The Prime Minister leads a Government who
have increased national debt by £700 billion,

63
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:14,310
more than every Labour Government in history
put together. Debt has risen every year they

64
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,910
have been in office. We know their economic
plan was long term. Does she want to tell

65
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,880
us how far into the long term it will be before
we get the debt falling?

66
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,820
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman stands up and talks

67
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,600
about debt. This is a Labour party that will
be going into the election pledged to borrow

68
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:45,750
an extra £500 billion. What does that mean
for ordinary working people? Well, I will

69
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,020
tell him what it means. We know what Labour’s
plans would entail because we have been told

70
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,550
by the former Labour shadow Chancellor. He
said that if Labour were in power,

71
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,950
“you’d have to double income tax, double
National Insurance, double council tax and

72
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,740
you’d have to double VAT as well.”

73
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,240
That is Labour’s plan for the economy.

74
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,740
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
All her Government have delivered is more

75
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,180
debt and less funding for schools and hospitals.
Schools funding is being cut for the first

76
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,740
time in a generation. The Prime Minister is
cutting £3 billion a year from school budgets

77
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,530
by 2020. She says that the Government have
created a stronger economy, so why are there

78
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:45,760
tax giveaways to the richest corporations
while our children’s schools are starved

79
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,550
of the resources they need to educate our
children for the future?

80
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,550
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman talks about levels

81
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,280
of funding for schools and the NHS. There
are record levels of funding going into schools

82
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,720
and record levels of funding going into the
NHS, but let us just talk about schools. It

83
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,790
is not just a question of funding; it is actually
a question of the quality of education provided

84
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:18,150
in schools. Some 1.8 million more children
are in good or outstanding schools under this

85
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,550
Conservative Government, which is 1.8 million
more children with a better chance for their

86
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,870
future. What would Labour give us? It would
be the same old one-size-fits-all, local authority-run

87
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,710
schools: “No choice, good or bad, trust
your luck.” We do not trust to luck, and

88
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,270
we will not trust the Labour party. We will
provide a good school place for every child.

89
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,610
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Many parents taking their children back to

90
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:52,320
school for the summer term will receive a
letter begging for funds to buy books and

91
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,130
fund the school. The Conservative manifesto
promised

92
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,720
“the amount of money following your child
into school will be protected.”

93
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,030
It is not. It is another Tory broken promise.

94
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:13,000
For the first time in its history, NHS funding
per patient will fall this year. The NHS has

95
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,030
been put into an all-year-round crisis by
this Government. Why are more people waiting

96
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:27,880
in pain, with millions of elderly people not
getting the care and dignity they deserve?

97
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,060
>> The Prime Minister:
I am proud of our record on the NHS. We saw

98
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,310
more doctors, more nurses, more midwives,
more general practitioners and more people

99
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:45,180
being treated in our national health service
last year than ever before, with record levels

100
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,540
of funding going into our national health
service. We can only do that with a strong

101
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,180
economy. What do we know we would get from
the Labour party? Bankruptcy and chaos.

102
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,900
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
That is a very good reason for why we should

103
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:11,530
have a debate about it, because it is another
Tory broken promise. A broken promise of the

104
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,350
Tory manifesto, which said that they would
continue to

105
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,440
“spend more on the NHS, in real terms”.

106
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,120
Say that to those waiting in A&amp;E departments
and to those who cannot leave hospital because

107
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
social care is not available.

108
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:35,030
Is it not the truth that, over the last seven
years, the Tories have broken every promise

109
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:41,820
on living standards, the deficit, debt, the
national health service and school funding?

110
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,139
Why should anyone believe a word they say
over the next seven weeks?

111
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,820
>> The Prime Minister:
I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that

112
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:00,130
I will be out campaigning and taking to voters
the message of not only the record of this

113
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,750
Conservative Government, but, crucially, of
our plans to make Brexit a success and to

114
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,780
build a stronger Britain for the future. Every
vote for the Conservatives will make it harder

115
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,870
for those who want to stop me getting the
job done. Every vote for the Conservatives

116
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,120
will make me stronger when I negotiate for
Britain with the European Union. And every

117
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,470
vote for the Conservatives will mean we can
stick to our plan for a stronger Britain and

118
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,110
take the right long-term decisions for a more
secure future for this country.

119
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:41,600
>> Michelle Donelan (Chippenham) (Con):
For years I have been campaigning for fairer

120
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,601
funding in Wiltshire schools. Will the Prime
Minister please reaffirm her commitment to

121
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,010
this and to a review of the pupil premium
to encompass other forms of key disadvantage,

122
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,800
such as being a young carer, having mental
health problems and dealing with bereavement?

123
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,220
In this way, we can create a country that
will work for everyone.

124
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,100
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises a very important point,

125
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,620
and I know she has campaigned long and hard
in her constituency and worked hard for her

126
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,590
constituents on this and other issues. We
want to ensure that young people, irrespective

127
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,310
of their background, have the opportunity
to make the most of their talents, and the

128
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,271
point of our reforms is to try to end the
postcode lottery in school funding and to

129
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:28,380
support our plan for a fairer society, where
success is based on merit and not on privilege.

130
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,931
She refers to the pupil premium, and that
is of course worth £2.5 billion a year. It

131
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:38,120
is an important part of our policy because
it gives schools extra support for pupils

132
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,150
from disadvantaged backgrounds, but I think
it is right that schools are best placed to

133
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,180
prioritise the needs of their pupils and can
use their funding to ensure that they are

134
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,250
supporting any pupil facing disadvantage,
financial or otherwise.

135
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,660
>> Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):
May I join in the condolences extended by

136
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,820
the Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour
party?

137
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,070
The tone and content of democratic debates,
including in a general election, are very

138
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,720
important to all of us, so does the Prime
Minister agree that political opponents are

139
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,210
not “saboteurs”, and that all elected
mainstream parties and parliamentarians have

140
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,200
a mandate and that that should be respected?

141
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,560
>> The Prime Minister:
In this House and in this Parliament it is

142
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,279
right that we have proper debate and scrutiny
of proposals put forward by the Government,

143
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,600
and that arguments on both sides of the House
are rightly challenged and those discussions

144
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,100
take place. But I say to the right hon. Gentleman
that what the British people—what the people

145
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,520
of the United Kingdom—voted for last year
was for the UK to leave the European Union.

146
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,730
We have set that process in motion; there
is no turning back. But it is clear from statements

147
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,730
made by the Scottish nationalists and others
that they want to use this House to try to

148
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,880
frustrate that process. I will be asking the
British people for a mandate to complete Brexit

149
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,779
and to make a success of it.

150
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,650
>> Angus Robertson:
It is disappointing that the Prime Minister

151
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:20,430
did not take the opportunity to condemn intemperate
language in describing other democratic politicians

152
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,630
as—[Interruption.] There is heckling from
the Government side, and I think the Prime

153
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,440
Minister should take the opportunity to underline
something that we should all agree on: that

154
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,900
describing people in the way we have seen
them described in some daily newspapers by

155
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,410
some leading politicians is not acceptable.

156
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,370
Most people know that the reason we are having
a general election is because of the woeful

157
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,160
state of the Labour party. If the Prime Minister
is so confident that her hard Brexit, pro-austerity,

158
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,720
anti-immigration case is right, she should
debate it with Opposition leaders during the

159
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,590
campaign. We look forward to the straight
fight between the Scottish National party

160
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,649
and the Tories. Will the Prime Minister tell
the people why she is running scared of a

161
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,069
televised debate with Nicola Sturgeon?

162
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:15,470
>> The Prime Minister:
First, may I say to the right hon. Gentleman

163
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,060
that one of the crucial things we have in
this country that underpins our democracy

164
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,290
is a free press? I believe that is important
and I believe that people in this Chamber

165
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:31,330
should stand up for the freedom of the press.
As to the TV debates, I can assure him that

166
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,560
I will be out there campaigning in every part
of the United Kingdom, taking out there our

167
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,350
proud record of a Conservative Government
that has delivered for every part of the United

168
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,529
Kingdom.

169
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,480
I might also suggest to the Scottish nationalists
that now is the time for them to put aside—[Interruption.]

170
00:16:49,480 --> 00:17:01,080
Wait for it: now is the time for them to put
aside their tunnel vision on independence

171
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,159
and actually explain to the Scottish people
why the SNP Government are not putting as

172
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:11,174
much money into the health service as they
have been given from the UK, they are not

173
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:14,780
exercising the powers they have been given
and Scottish education is getting worse. It

174
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,270
is time they got back to the day job.

175
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:30,400
>> Mary Robinson (Cheadle) (Con):
I too welcome the announcement from the Prime

176
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,980
Minister yesterday, and I look forward to
the general election and to taking my positive

177
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,140
message to my constituents in Cheadle in June.
Over the past two years, I have pressed for

178
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,550
first-class transport infrastructure for Cheadle,
and this week I launched my transport survey

179
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:52,179
so my constituents can have their say on what
is needed to keep Cheadle moving and be at

180
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:58,040
the heart of the northern powerhouse. Does
my right hon. Friend agree that residents

181
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,460
in Cheadle need to vote Conservative on 8
June to ensure that we get continued investment

182
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,450
in transport and infrastructure, not only
in Cheadle but across the north-west?

183
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,400
>> The Prime Minister:
I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend on

184
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,840
that point. I know she has been working very
hard for her constituents in Cheadle on transport

185
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,760
and other issues. Of course, it is under this
Government that the Department for Transport

186
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,720
is investing £290 million to improve transport
links to Manchester airport through Cheadle,

187
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,010
and £2.1 million has been committed to improving
walking and cycling routes around the Cheadle

188
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,470
Hulme district centre. That is why the choice
is so clear. As my hon. Friend says, if she

189
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,250
wants to see that funding for infrastructure,
we need a strong economy, which only the Conservatives

190
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,919
can deliver.

191
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,730
>> Jeff Smith (Manchester, Withington) (Lab):
Because of the Prime Minister’s changes

192
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,610
to education funding, every school in the
country will face real- terms cuts. Manchester

193
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:05,980
will be hit harder than anywhere outside London—[Interruption.]
It’s true. Chorlton High School and Parrs

194
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,920
Wood High School in my constituency will each
lose the equivalent of more than 30 teachers.

195
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,290
I ask the Prime Minister the same question
a headteacher asked me: what would she cut

196
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:24,720
to balance the books and what subjects would
she choose to sack teachers from?

197
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,550
>> The Prime Minister:
As the hon. Gentleman knows, record levels

198
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:37,420
of funding are going into our schools. Everybody
across this House has recognised for many

199
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,470
years that the current funding formula is
not fair across the country, and it is necessary

200
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,170
for us to look for a fairer funding formula.
We have consulted on that and will obviously

201
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,710
be responding to that consultation. As the
hon. Gentleman faces up to the election, I

202
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,540
note that last year he failed to back—he
opposed—the leader of his party. If the

203
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,650
hon. Gentleman was not willing to support
him as leader of his party then, why should

204
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,180
his voters support him as leader of the country?

205
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:14,350
>> David Mackintosh (Northampton South) (Con):
The only way to fund crucial infrastructure

206
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,120
is with a strong economy. To that end, does
my right hon. Friend agree that the St James

207
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,140
Mill link road in Northampton would help with
traffic flow in the town and unlock development

208
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,430
in the enterprise zone? Will the next Conservative
Government continue to support me, as the

209
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,929
MP, in backing the scheme?

210
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:37,700
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we

211
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,550
need to have a strong economy if we are to
be able to fund that crucial infrastructure.

212
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,220
That is why, since 2015, we have increased
our annual investment in economic infrastructure

213
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,870
by almost 60% to £22 billion per year by
2021, including £2.6 billion for improvements

214
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,780
in transport projects. I am happy to see the
link road proposal being put forward by his

215
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,330
local enterprise partnership; it will improve
access to business and unlock development

216
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,050
in the area. My hon. Friend has worked hard
to see it happen, and I am sure he will continue

217
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,810
to campaign on issues like that which matter
so much to his constituents.

218
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,600
>> Gerald Jones (Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)
(Lab):

219
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,290
Recent changes to housing benefit entitlement
for 18 to 21-year-olds will affect 195 young

220
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,120
people in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. The
Government are constantly challenging young

221
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,040
people to train and leave benefits for the
world of work, but homelessness charities

222
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,549
such as Llamau are concerned that the changes
will be a major barrier to learning and training

223
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:38,480
for youngsters who do not have a safe and
secure environment at home. Does the Prime

224
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,350
Minister agree that we should be doing everything
we can to help young people in the job market,

225
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,850
including by offering financial support for
housing? Will she pledge to strengthen the

226
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:53,330
guidelines so that no more young people risk
falling through the net and ending up on the

227
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,350
streets?

228
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,190
>> The Prime Minister:
The principle behind the changing of housing

229
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,570
benefit is the right one, which is to say
that it is only fair that people are not able

230
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,080
to make decisions when they are on benefit
that they would not be able to make if they

231
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,510
are actually in work. However, it is right
that we ensure that those young people who

232
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,790
have a particular difficulty with staying
at home are supported through the system,

233
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,240
which is why significant exemptions are in
place. We recognise that need and have taken

234
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
it on board.

235
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,789
>> Mr Speaker:
The next question is a closed question.

236
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:29,789
>> Mr Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):
If she will visit Kettering constituency.

237
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,280
>> The Prime Minister:
I would be happy to visit the Kettering constituency

238
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,410
in the future if my diary allows. In fact,
I suspect that I will be visiting quite a

239
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,320
few constituencies across the country in the
next few weeks.

240
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,860
>> Mr Hollobone:
Life for ordinary working families is harder

241
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:54,210
than many people at Westminster realise: “You
have a job, but not necessarily job security.

242
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,280
You are just about managing, but you are worried
about the cost of living and getting your

243
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,010
kids into a good school. You are doing your
best, and a Conservative Government will do

244
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:09,190
all it can to make sure that you have more
control over your life.” These were the

245
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,920
inspiring words of the Prime Minister when
she took office last July. Will she come to

246
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:23,021
Kettering, Britain’s most average town,
and repeat these, her core beliefs? If she

247
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:29,010
does so, I know she will be warmly and widely
acclaimed as the Prime Minister this country

248
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:36,043
needs for the next five years.

249
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:37,630
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right to highlight

250
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,690
ordinary working families who do rely on the
Government to provide stability and certainty

251
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,510
for them, and that is what this Conservative
Government have done. Looking at what we have

252
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,750
done, we see that we have supported jobs through
significant new investment in skills, we have

253
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,960
invested in public services such as childcare
and the NHS, and we have enhanced consumer

254
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,900
protections. I am happy to repeat the words
that I said outside Downing Street on 13 July

255
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,730
last year, but it is Conservatives in government
who have delivered strong and stable leadership,

256
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,310
and that is the message I will be taking out
to the country during this election.

257
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:16,980
>> Jenny Chapman (Darlington) (Lab):
Does the Prime Minister support the people

258
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,380
of Darlington who oppose the downgrading of
their A&amp;E and maternity services? They

259
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,190
want an answer they can trust, Prime Minister.
Is it yes or no?

260
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,130
>> The Prime Minister:
The proposals for the configuration of health

261
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:41,610
services in local areas is a matter that is
being determined by local commissions in the

262
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,840
best interests of services in the local area.

263
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,160
I am interested that the hon. Lady refers
to the views of her constituents in Darlington.

264
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,280
She has said of the Leader of the Opposition,
the leader of her party:

265
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,740
“My constituents in Darlington have made
it clear to me that they cannot support the

266
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,690
Labour party under your leadership.”

267
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,070
How can they possibly support him as leader
of the country?

268
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:13,070
>> Maria Caulfield (Lewes) (Con):
May I welcome the fact that, because the Conservatives

269
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,530
have managed the economy so well, there is
record school funding this year? East Sussex,

270
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:23,179
for example, has some of the best performing
schools in the country, and they are set to

271
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,650
receive an increase of 3%. However, in Lewes,
in my constituency, many of my small rural

272
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,170
primary schools are set to see a reduction.
Will the Prime Minister guarantee that she

273
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,070
will look at the issue of rural primary school
funding so that we can even out the distribution

274
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,070
of money?

275
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,370
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point

276
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,290
out the record levels of funding that are
going into schools. It is also the case, as

277
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,530
I said earlier, that over the years there
has been a general acceptance across this

278
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,070
House that the current system of funding is
not fair in certain parts of the country.

279
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,660
That is why we want to end that postcode lottery
and look at a system that is fairer and more

280
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:07,370
up to date and that will support our plan
for a society where progress is based on merit

281
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,960
and not on privilege. I am very happy to look
at her concerns. I recognise that small rural

282
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,630
schools have particular issues, and I am happy
to look at them to ensure that we get the

283
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,269
funding formula right and that we can spread
the money as fairly as possible.

284
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:27,250
>> Graham Jones (Hyndburn) (Lab):
Every school in Hyndburn is facing a massive

285
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:35,169
budget cut. Why is a child in Hyndburn worth
less than a child in Tory heartlands in the

286
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:36,749
south?

287
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:44,620
>> The Prime Minister:
Currently, significant sums of money are going

288
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:51,230
to children in certain schools, sometimes
double the amount going to a child in another

289
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,780
school. We need to find a fairer system. We
have consulted on that system and we will

290
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,220
be responding to that consultation.

291
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:07,000
I note what the hon. Gentleman has said about
the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of

292
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,730
his party. He said:

293
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:15,210
“He’s not fit to rule. The public see
this is a man who doesn’t take responsibility

294
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,150
seriously and that he can’t take the party
forward other than in a divisive way.”

295
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,289
If he cannot take the party forward, how can
he hope to take the country forward?

296
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:29,260
>> Derek Thomas (St Ives) (Con):
Small businesses provide the lion’s share

297
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:35,620
of jobs in Cornwall and on the Isles of Scilly.
The difficulties of attracting credit, rising

298
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,789
operational costs and red tape make running
a small business an increasingly difficult

299
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:46,400
task. What can my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister do to help small businesses so that

300
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,669
they can continue to be the engine of rural
economies like West Cornwall’s?

301
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,610
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right that small

302
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,539
businesses are the engine of the economy.
I know that he has been a champion of small

303
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:06,500
businesses in his constituency. He recognises
that if we are to ensure that we can create

304
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,671
those jobs, we have to encourage small businesses.
That is why in the Budget my right hon. Friend

305
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:17,520
the Chancellor provided £435 million to support
businesses in England facing the steepest

306
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,320
business rate increases, why we will cut business
rates by nearly £9 billion over the next

307
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,289
five years, and why we have listened to small
businesses and given more than 3 million of

308
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:35,460
them an extra year to prepare for Making Tax
Digital. I recognise the importance of small

309
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,539
businesses in Cornwall, and I look forward
to visiting in the next few weeks and being

310
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,970
able to talk my hon. Friend and others about
the importance of small businesses in the

311
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,970
county.

312
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:52,789
>> Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
I join the Prime Minister in the expressions

313
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:57,390
of condolence that she led earlier.

314
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,929
This election can change the direction of
our country, from the consequences of a potential

315
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:11,250
hard Brexit outside the single market to the
future of our NHS and social care, our schools

316
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:18,160
and our environment. The British public deserve
to hear the party leaders set out their plans

317
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,990
and debate them publicly, but the Prime Minister
has refused to take part in televised leaders

318
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:41,730
debates. Back in 1992, when she and I were
both candidates, we debated publicly, forcefully

319
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:48,860
and amicably. Indeed, she called out the then
incumbent for not showing up for some of those

320
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,980
debates. Why will she not debate those issues
publicly now? What is she scared of?

321
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,830
>> The Prime Minister:
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I will

322
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,500
be debating these issues publicly across the
country, as will every single member of the

323
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,670
Conservative team. We will be taking out there
the proud record of a Conservative Government,

324
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,460
but, more than that, we will be taking our
plans for the future of this country, for

325
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,410
making Brexit a success and delivering a stronger
Britain. He talks about the possibility of

326
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,660
changing the future of this country. What
do we know that the leader of the Labour party,

327
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,560
the leader of the Liberal Democrats and the
leader of the Scottish nationalists have in

328
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,919
common? Corbyn, Farron and Sturgeon want to
unite together to divide our country, and

329
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,610
we will not let them do it.

330
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:46,280
>> John Stevenson (Carlisle) (Con):
The Government wish to pursue a national industrial

331
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,820
strategy. Cumbria has some specific strengths,
such as tourism, agriculture and nuclear,

332
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,690
but it also has some weaknesses. Will the
Prime Minister agree that any industrial strategy

333
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,970
in the next Parliament must take into account
regional and sub-regional factors, and will

334
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,660
she be receptive to a Cumbrian industrial
strategy that works within a national one?

335
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,500
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend points to a very important

336
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,120
part of our plans for a stronger Britain for
the future, which is the modern industrial

337
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,650
strategy that we are developing, because we
want an economy that works for everyone, delivers

338
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:28,049
good, high-skilled, high-paid jobs and creates
conditions for competitive world-leading businesses

339
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:32,120
to prosper here in the United Kingdom. But
he is right to say that as we look at that

340
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,049
industrial strategy we also need to look at
particular factors in particular parts of

341
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:41,080
the country. He has long been a champion not
just for Carlisle but for Cumbria. I recognise

342
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,990
the need, as does the Business Department,
to tailor the industrial strategy according

343
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,360
to the needs of particular areas of the country.

344
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,310
>> Yvette Cooper (Normanton, Pontefract and
Castleford) (Lab):

345
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,750
The Prime Minister yesterday said that she
was calling a general election because Parliament

346
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,320
was blocking Brexit, but three quarters of
MPs and two thirds of the Lords voted for

347
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,110
article 50, so that’s not true, is it? A
month ago, she told her official spokesman

348
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:18,080
to rule out an early general election, and
that wasn’t true either, was it? She wants

349
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,210
us to believe that she is a woman of her word.
Isn’t the truth that we cannot believe a

350
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:33,250
single word she says?

351
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:45,750
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The House is rather over-excited. The

352
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,029
question has been heard. The answer will be
heard.

353
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:57,240
>> The Prime Minister:
This House and this Parliament voted to trigger

354
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,750
article 50, but the Labour party made it clear
that it was thinking of voting against the

355
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:17,240
final deal, the Scottish nationalists have
said that they will vote against the legislation

356
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,559
necessary to leave the European Union, the
Liberal Democrats say that they are going

357
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:26,890
to grind Government to a standstill, and the
House of Lords has threatened to stop us every

358
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,520
inch of the way. I think it is right now to
ask the British people to put their trust

359
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,640
in me and the Conservative party to deliver
on their vote last year—a Brexit plan that

360
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,831
will make a success for this country and deliver
a stronger, fairer, global Britain in the

361
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:42,831
future.

362
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:51,010
>> Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam) (Con):
I have seen rats and fly-tipping as a result

363
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,559
of bins not having been emptied for up to
three weeks across Lib Dem-run Sutton following

364
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,540
a shambolic change to refuse collections.
[Interruption.]When bin collections get into

365
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,630
the national headlines, you know something
has gone wrong. Does my right hon. Friend

366
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:13,210
agree that, in accepting greater delegated
powers, elected councillors must consult residents

367
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,719
properly, plan major changes carefully and
take full responsibility as accountable representatives

368
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,819
when things go wrong?

369
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,159
>> The Prime Minister:
I do not know why there are howls of derision

370
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,219
from the Opposition Benches, because my hon.
Friend raises an important point about an

371
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,589
issue that actually matters to people up and
down the country. It is our goal to reduce

372
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:39,399
littering and litter in England to ensure
that our high streets, villages and parks

373
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,619
are the cleanest and most pleasant places
that they can be. We have published the first

374
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:49,979
ever national litter strategy for England,
and we are supporting comprehensive and frequent

375
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:54,398
bin collections. But what my hon. Friend says
the Liberal Democrat-run Sutton Council is

376
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,519
doing shows not only that the Liberal Democrats
charge the highest council taxes, which we

377
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,940
already knew, but that under the Liberal Democrats
you pay more and get less.

378
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,680
>> Patricia Gibson (North Ayrshire and Arran)
(SNP):

379
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,430
Will the Prime Minister join the Scottish
Government, North Ayrshire Council and all

380
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:19,099
Ayrshire local authorities by today pledging
to support the Ayrshire growth deal, which

381
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:24,690
requires £350 million of targeted investment
to regenerate Ayrshire and improve the lives

382
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,151
and prospects of all its people?

383
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:32,640
>> The Prime Minister:
As the hon. Lady will know, we have already

384
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,680
shown our commitment to growth deals in Scotland
with the deals that have already been agreed.

385
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,299
I understand that my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Scotland has met the

386
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:47,130
Scottish Government to discuss the growth
deal for Ayrshire. We are in discussions about

387
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,849
that deal, but we have shown our commitment
through the deals that have already been struck—for

388
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,170
example, for Aberdeen.

389
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:59,130
>> Sir David Amess (Southend West) (Con):
As part of Southend’s celebrations as the

390
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:09,529
alternative city of culture, stilt walkers
will walk non-stop from Southend to No. 10

391
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:13,690
Downing Street on the morning of Monday 1
May to raise money for the Music Man Project

392
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:20,420
to help people with learning difficulties,
and for a charity for child refugees. Will

393
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:28,349
my right hon. Friend arrange, on the morning
of Tuesday 2 May, for someone on her behalf

394
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:35,579
to receive the stilt walkers and accept from
Southend’s town crier the proclamation that

395
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:43,549
in this, the 125th anniversary of the founding
of the borough, Southend be declared a city?

396
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:52,450
>> The Prime Minister:
When I first heard about the stilt walkers,

397
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:58,930
I thought it sounded a bit of a tall order,
but I am sure they will be making great strides

398
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:04,009
as they approach Downing Street. I am pleased
to hear what my hon. Friend says about the

399
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:07,310
Southend celebrations, but also about the
efforts that are being made to raise funds

400
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,859
for very, very important causes. We will certainly
look very carefully at what can be done in

401
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,450
Downing Street when the stilt walkers arrive.

402
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:24,029
>> Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) (Lab):
Will the Prime Minister give a guarantee that

403
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:35,099
no Tory MP who is under investigation by the
police and the legal authorities over election

404
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:44,260
expenses in the last general election will
be a candidate in this election? If she will

405
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:53,869
not accept that, this is the most squalid
election campaign that has happened in my

406
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:54,869
lifetime.

407
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,260
>> The Prime Minister:
I stand by all the Conservative MPs who are

408
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,900
in this House and who will be out there standing
again, campaigning for a Conservative Government

409
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,179
who will give a brighter and better future
for this country.

410
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:20,910
>> Richard Benyon (Newbury) (Con):
I am proud that my party in government has

411
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:27,319
ensured that in this country we fulfil our
commitment to NATO to spend 2% of GDP on defence

412
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:35,010
and our commitment to the UN to spend 0.7%
of GNI on overseas aid. Will my right hon.

413
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,119
Friend please commit the future Conservative
Government to do the same?

414
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,569
>> The Prime Minister:
My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct.

415
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,170
Obviously we have committed to meet our NATO
pledge of 2% of GDP being spent on defence

416
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,790
every year of this decade. We are delivering
on that. We have got a £36 billion defence

417
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:58,380
budget that will rise to almost £40 billion
by 2020-21—the biggest in Europe and second

418
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:06,809
largest in NATO. We are meeting our UN commitment
to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas development

419
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:15,329
assistance. I can assure him that we remain
committed, as a Conservative party, to ensuring

420
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,680
the defence and security of this country and
to working for a stronger world.

421
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,029
>> Mr Speaker:
Finally, Christian Matheson.

422
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:27,650
>> Christian Matheson (City of Chester) (Lab):
Schools in Cheshire West and Chester were

423
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:33,720
already underfunded by about £400 per pupil
on average before the new national fair funding

424
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,190
formula came in, and now every school in Chester
is cutting staff and raising class sizes.

425
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,250
That is how the Government have protected
the education budget, so will the Prime Minister

426
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:49,799
explain to the House why the national funding
fair formula provides neither fairness nor

427
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:50,969
funding?

428
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:56,460
>> The Prime Minister:
As I have said in this Chamber before, we

429
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,760
need to look at the funding formula. We have
published proposals for fair funding, we have

430
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,349
consulted on those proposals, and in due course
the Government will respond to those proposals.

431
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,990
I was very interested to see the hon. Gentleman
being interviewed yesterday and being asked

432
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,140
whether he would put a photograph of the Leader
of the Opposition on his election literature.

433
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,039
Sadly, he said that the only photographs he
wanted on his election literature were his

434
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,699
own; he was not prepared to support the leader
of his own party.
