1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,640
>>Paula Sherriff (Dewsbury) (Lab): If she
will list her official engagements for Wednesday

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,640
12 October.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:14,790
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,220
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,240
later today.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,390
>>Paula Sherriff: Previously, I worked in
an NHS service that the coalition Government

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,269
gifted to Virgin Care, which is now seeking
another contract covering my constituency.

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,920
Among many unethical practices that I witnessed,
Virgin imposed a system of double appointments,

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,630
forcing patients to have unnecessary extra
consultations before surgery, boosting its

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,550
profits at the expense of the taxpayer and
patient safety. Is that acceptable? If not,

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,130
what is the Prime Minister prepared to do
about it?

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,510
>>The Prime Minister: Of course, what we want
to see in the provision of local services

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,510
are the best services possible for local people.
The hon. Lady talks about outsourcing of services

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,469
in the NHS; I have to say to her that the
party that put greater privatisation into

15
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,570
the NHS was not my party but the Labour party.

16
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,280
>>Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con): What
recent assessment she has made of (a) the

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:21,950
performance of the economy and (b) the adequacy
of provision of public services in the west

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,110
midlands; and if she will make a statement.

19
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,680
>>The Prime Minister: The west midlands economy,
I have to say, is in a very positive position

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,040
at the moment. I am very pleased to say that
since 2010 nearly 200,000 more people are

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,439
at work there, and there are 42,000 new businesses.
I saw the strength of the economy when I was

22
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,440
in Birmingham last week. Of course, we are
giving the west midlands new powers with the

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,060
devolution deal and the election of a Mayor.
Andy Street, with his business and local experience,

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,600
would be a very good Mayor for the west midlands.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,360
>>Michael Fabricant: On the subject of the
NHS, 18 months ago my wonderful doctor, Helen

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,560
Stokes-Lampard, suggested that I have a general
“well man” check-up. It is just as well

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,330
that I did: the blood test revealed a problem
with my prostate, despite the fact that I

28
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,620
was symptom-free. I was immediately referred
to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham,

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,110
whose staff were simply wonderful. After a
period of surveillance, I had a prostatectomy

30
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,170
back in June.

31
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:38,790
But hey—I’m now fine! [Hon. Members: “Hooray!”]
I want to thank the whole team at the QE,

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,320
including my surgeon Alan Doherty and my excellent
specialist prostate nurse Richard Gledhill,

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,730
who gave me practical advice. But, in the
next 10 years, there will be a real shortage

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,319
of specialist prostate and urology nurses,
as many are due for retirement. May I ask

35
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,590
the Prime Minister what the Government can
do to avert a shortage of these much needed

36
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,590
specialist nurses?

37
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,500
>>The Prime Minister: May I say to my hon.
Friend that the whole House is pleased to

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:21,360
see him back in his position as his normal
exuberant self? He raises a very serious issue.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,379
I join him in commending not only those doctors,
nurses and other health service staff who

40
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,871
treated him for his prostate cancer, but those
doctors and nurses who, day in, day out, are

41
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:39,370
ensuring that, as we see, cancer survival
rates are at a record high.

42
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,650
The Government are putting more money into
awareness of cancer problems. We will look

43
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,640
at the training of nurses—50,000 nurses
are in training—and continue to make sure

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,780
that the specialisms are available to do the
work that is necessary in the health service.

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:03,490
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): I,
too, join the Prime Minister in wishing the

46
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,049
hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)
well and obviously hope the treatment he got

47
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,239
is the same treatment that everybody else
gets, because we want good treatment for everybody

48
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,579
in our society. [Interruption.] It is not
controversial—I am just wishing him well.

49
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:27,470
Is that okay? I am sorry to start on such
a controversial note, Mr Speaker. I do apologise.

50
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,980
At the Conservative party conference, the
Prime Minister said she wants Britain to be

51
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,480
“a country where it doesn’t matter where
you were born”, but the Home Secretary’s

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,020
flagship announcement was to name and shame
companies that employ foreign workers. Could

53
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,760
the Prime Minister explain why where someone
was born clearly does matter to members of

54
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
her Cabinet?

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:05:00,020
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I congratulate
the right hon. Gentleman on winning the Labour

56
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:15,790
leadership election? [Interruption.] I welcome
him back to his place in this House as his

57
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,350
normal self. The policy that he has just described
was never the policy that the Home Secretary

58
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,260
announced? There was no naming and shaming,
no published list of foreign workers, no published

59
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:37,670
data. What we are going to consult on is whether
we should bring ourselves in line with countries

60
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,100
such as the United States of America, which
collect data in order to be able to ensure

61
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,540
that they are getting the right skills training
for workers in their economy.

62
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,350
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I am most grateful to the
over 300,000 people that voted for me to become

63
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:07,250
the leader of my party, which is rather more
than voted for the Prime Minister to become

64
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:23,090
the leader of her party. She seems to be slightly
unaware of what is going on: first, the Home

65
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,010
Secretary briefed that companies would be
named and shamed; the Education Secretary

66
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,712
clarified that data would only be kept by
Government; yesterday, No. 10 said the proposal

67
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:36,940
was for consultation; and the Home Secretary
clarified the whole matter by saying, “it’s

68
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,370
one of the tools we are going to use”. This
Government have no answers, just gimmicks

69
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,180
and scapegoats. Yesterday, we learned that
pregnant women will be forced to hand over

70
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,770
their passports at NHS hospitals. No ultrasound
without photographic ID—heavily pregnant

71
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,370
women sent home on icy roads to get a passport.
Are these really the actions of “a country

72
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,170
where it doesn’t matter where you were born”?

73
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:12,320
>>The Prime Minister: I have made absolutely
clear the policy that the Home Secretary set

74
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,220
out. The right hon. Gentleman raises issues
around the health service. I think it is right

75
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,620
that we should say that we ensure, when we
are providing health services to people, that

76
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,720
they are free at the point of delivery; that
people are eligible to have those services;

77
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,150
that where there are people who come to this
country to use our health service, and who

78
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,220
should be paying for it, the health service
actually identifies them and makes sure that

79
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,310
it gets the money from them. I would have
thought that that would be an uncontroversial

80
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,440
view. Of course, emergency care will be provided,
when necessary, absolutely without those questions,

81
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,520
but what is important is that we ensure that
where people should be paying, because they

82
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,810
do not have the right to access free care
in the health service, they do so.

83
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,330
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Some of the Prime Minister’s
colleagues on the leave side promised £350

84
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:13,000
million a week extra for the NHS. She does
not seem to have answers to the big questions

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,560
facing Britain. On Monday, the Secretary for
Brexit, when questioned about the Government’s

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,110
approach to single market access, replied:
“We…need hard data about the size of the

87
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,090
problem in terms of both money and jobs”
It would have been much easier if he had simply

88
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,159
asked his colleague, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, because he would have been able

89
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,250
to tell him that the Treasury forecast is
a £66 billion loss to the economy—7.5%

90
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,450
of the GDP. Can the Prime Minister now confirm
that access to the single market is a red

91
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,610
line for the Government, or is it not?

92
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,570
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
has asked me this question before. [Interruption.].

93
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,490
He says it is a simple question, and I will
give him the simple answer: what we are going

94
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,010
to do is deliver on the vote of the British
people to leave the European Union; what we

95
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,780
are going to do is be ambitious in our negotiations,
to negotiate the best deal for the British

96
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,191
people, and that will include the maximum
possible access to the European market, for

97
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:23,770
firms to trade with, and operate within, the
European market. But I am also clear that

98
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,900
the vote of the British people said that we
should control the movement of people from

99
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
the EU into the UK, and, unlike the right
hon. Gentleman, we believe we should deliver

100
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,380
on what the British people want.

101
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,740
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Someone once said that in
leaving the single market “we risk a loss

102
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,740
of investors and businesses…and we risk
going backwards when it comes to international

103
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,470
trade.” That person is now the Prime Minister,
and that was before the referendum.

104
00:09:50,470 --> 00:10:00,920
The Japanese Government wrote to the Prime
Minister in September, worried about a shambolic

105
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Brexit. Many Japanese companies are major
investors in Britain—such as Nissan in Sunderland,

106
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,490
which has already halted its investment—and
140,000 people in Britain work for Japanese-owned

107
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,180
companies. They have made it clear that those
jobs and that investment depend on single

108
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:26,550
market access. What reassurance can she give
workers today, desperately worried about their

109
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,760
future, their company and their jobs?

110
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,670
>>The Prime Minister: First, I would say to
the right hon. Gentleman that the biggest

111
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,510
vote of confidence that we had in Britain
after the referendum vote was the £24 billion

112
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,870
investment from a Japanese company, SoftBank,
in taking over Arm. Secondly, in relation

113
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,970
to what we are doing in our negotiations,
he does not seem to get what the future is

114
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,060
going to be about. The UK will be leaving
the European Union. We are not asking ourselves

115
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,980
what bits of membership we want to retain.
We are saying: what is the right relationship

116
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,130
for the UK to have for the maximum benefit
of our economy and of the citizens of this

117
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,390
country?

118
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,561
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The right hon. Member for
Broxtowe (Anna Soubry) has said that “there

119
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,650
is a danger that this Government appear to
be turning their back on the single market”.

120
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,980
Staying in the single market was, indeed,
a commitment in the Conservative party manifesto.

121
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,870
The reality is that, since the Brexit vote,
the trade deficit is widening, growth forecasts

122
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,550
have been downgraded, the value of the pound
is down 16%, and an alliance of the British

123
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,260
Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of
British Industry, the British Retail Consortium

124
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,010
and the Trades Union Congress have all made
representations to the Prime Minister demanding

125
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,870
clarity. Is the Prime Minister really willing
to risk a shambolic Tory Brexit just to appease

126
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,990
the people behind her?

127
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,410
>>The Prime Minister: What the Conservative
party committed to in its manifesto was to

128
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,820
give the British people a referendum on whether
to stay in the European Union. We gave the

129
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,070
British people that vote, and they have given
their decision: we will be leaving the European

130
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,010
Union. In doing that, we will negotiate the
right deal for the UK, which means the right

131
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,529
deal in terms of operating within and trading
with the European market. That is what matters

132
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,450
to companies here in the UK, and that is what
we are going to be ambitious about delivering.

133
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,470
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The right hon. and learned
Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) often has

134
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,010
a mot juste to help us in these debates. He
simply said—[Interruption.]

135
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,490
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I want to hear about
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe.

136
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,990
>>Jeremy Corbyn: In his own inimitable way,
the right hon. and learned Gentleman said:

137
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,500
“The reason the pound keeps zooming south
is that absolutely nobody has the faintest

138
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,180
idea what exactly we’re going to put in
place.” Those of us on the Labour Benches

139
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,401
do respect the decision of the British people
to leave the European Union, but this is a

140
00:12:55,401 --> 00:13:01,390
Government that drew up no plans for Brexit;
that now has no strategy for negotiating Brexit;

141
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,570
and that offers no clarity, no transparency
and no chance of scrutiny of the process for

142
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,200
developing a strategy. The jobs and incomes
of millions of our people are at stake. The

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,710
pound is plummeting, business is worrying
and the Government have no answers. The Prime

144
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,500
Minister says she will not give a running
commentary, but is it not time the Government

145
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,320
stopped running away from the looming threat
to jobs and businesses in this country and

146
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,779
to the living standards of millions of people?

147
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,660
>>The Prime Minister: Unlike the right hon.
Gentleman, I am optimistic about the prospects

148
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,130
of this country once we leave the European
Union; I am optimistic about the trade deals

149
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,670
that other countries are now actively coming
to us to say they want to make with the United

150
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,730
Kingdom; and I am optimistic about how we
will be able to ensure that our economy grows

151
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,480
outside the European Union. But I have to
say to the right hon. Gentleman that Labour

152
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,280
did not want a referendum on this issue—we,
the Conservatives, gave the British people

153
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,260
a referendum; and Labour did not like the
result—we are listening to the British people

154
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,810
and delivering on that result. [Interruption.]
The shadow Foreign Secretary is shouting from

155
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:15,750
a sedentary position. The shadow Foreign Secretary
wants a second vote. I have to say to her

156
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,180
that I would have thought Labour MPs would
have learned this lesson: you can ask the

157
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:29,290
same question again; you still get the answer
you don’t want.

158
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:41,350
>>Steve Double (St Austell and Newquay) (Con):
Despite several rounds of European regional

159
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,529
development funding, the Cornish economy continues
to lag about 30% behind the UK average. Does

160
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,860
the Prime Minister agree that Brexit provides
us with the opportunity to develop our own

161
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,232
economic programme, which will be less bureaucratic
and more effectively targeted and will offer

162
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:03,500
better value for money for the taxpayer, and
will she confirm that her Government will

163
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,470
continue to invest in the poorer regions of
our country, such as Cornwall, once we leave

164
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,580
the EU?

165
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,880
>>The Prime Minister: I can give my hon. Friend
that assurance. What I said at our party conference,

166
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,990
and have been saying since I became Prime
Minister, is that we want an economy that

167
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,500
works for everyone; that means for every part
of our country, including areas such as Cornwall

168
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,100
and the Isles of Scilly. We have already negotiated
a devolution deal with Cornwall, which was

169
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,002
signed in 2015; that demonstrates that we
recognise the challenges that Cornwall faces.

170
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:38,230
We are open to further discussions on ways
in which we can improve Cornwall’s economy

171
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,230
for the future.

172
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:46,710
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): The European
Commission against Racism and Intolerance

173
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,779
has found that there are “a number of areas
of concern” regarding political discourse

174
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,470
and hate speech in the UK, as well as violent
racial and religious attacks. Police statistics

175
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,820
show a sharp rise in Islamophobic, anti-Semitic
and xenophobic assaults over the past year.

176
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:13,170
Does the Prime Minister agree that all mainstream
Governments and mainstream political parties

177
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,590
should do everything they can to oppose xenophobia
and racism?

178
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,230
>>The Prime Minister: I have been very clear
from this Dispatch Box on a number of occasions

179
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:29,590
that there is absolutely no place in our society
for racism or hate crime. It is right that

180
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:35,200
the police investigate allegations of hate
crime where they occur. I am pleased to say

181
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,580
that as Home Secretary I was able to bring
in arrangements that improved the recording

182
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:49,380
of hate crime. We also improved the requirement
on police specifically to record hate crime

183
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:58,300
relating to faith, so that we can see when
Islamophobia is taking place, as well as anti-Semitism

184
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,250
and other types of hate crime. There is no
place for such crime in our society. With

185
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,740
one voice, from across this Chamber, we should
make that absolutely clear, and give our police

186
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,750
every support in dealing with it.

187
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,480
>>Angus Robertson: I remind the Prime Minister
that when she was Home Secretary she put advertising

188
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,730
vans on the streets of this country telling
foreigners to go home. At her party conference

189
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:28,050
we heard that her party wishes to register
foreigners working in the UK. The crackdown

190
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,160
and the rhetoric against foreigners from this
Government have led to even UKIP—UKIP—saying

191
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,970
that things have gone too far. Across the
length and breadth of this land people are

192
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:51,470
totally disgusted by the xenophobic language
of her Government. Will she now confirm that

193
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,020
her Government’s intention is still to go
ahead with the registration of foreign workers,

194
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,410
but that we apparently should not worry, because
her Government will keep it secret?

195
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,970
>>The Prime Minister: May I say very gently
to the right hon. Gentleman that I answered

196
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,260
two questions on that earlier? I suggest he
should have listened to the answers I gave

197
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,940
then.

198
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:27,790
>>Daniel Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham)
(Con): We have empowered local doctors to

199
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:34,630
take real leadership over important reconfiguration
proposals. In Shropshire, 300 doctors, surgeons

200
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:40,120
and clinicians have been working on a vital
reconfiguration of A&E services in Shropshire

201
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,090
and in Wales. When they make their decision
on that later this month, it is very important

202
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,680
that the Government back them and provide
the capital funding required for this vital

203
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,380
change to enhance patient safety.

204
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,300
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important point. The configuration of services

205
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,780
in his constituency and others is obviously
a significant issue across the House. I am

206
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,370
pleased to say that we are now seeing more
people being treated in A&E. We will look

207
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,660
at the proposals. The point about how this
is being done is that local people should

208
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,510
be able to have their voice heard and the
decisions taken should reflect the needs in

209
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:24,350
a particular local area. We all want to see
that. A&E services are vital, and I pay tribute

210
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,010
to all those who work in A&E in hospitals
across the country.

211
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,020
>>Meg Hillier (Hackney South and Shoreditch)
(Lab/Co-op): The Public Accounts Committee

212
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:38,120
and the Comptroller and Auditor General have
both warned that the NHS budget is not sustainable.

213
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,800
When will the Prime Minister’s Government
wake up to the reality of growing demand,

214
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,080
avoid the political rhetoric and set a sustainable
NHS budget for this year and the future?

215
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,590
>>The Prime Minister: The Government took
a very simple approach. We asked the NHS itself

216
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,140
to propose its five-year plan for the NHS.
We asked it how much money it required. It

217
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,880
said £8 billion; we are giving it £10 billion,
which is more than the NHS said. Funding in

218
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,630
the NHS is at record levels. The only place
where money for the NHS is being cut is under

219
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,280
a Labour Administration in Wales.

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,059
>>Mr David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):
A young man with Asperger’s syndrome awaits

221
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:33,179
extradition to the United States to face charges
of computer hacking, and is then likely to

222
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:39,030
kill himself. It sounds familiar, but he is
not Gary McKinnon, who was saved by the Prime

223
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:44,620
Minister, but Lauri Love, who faces in effect
a death sentence. When the Prime Minister

224
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,260
introduced the forum bar to, in her words,
“provide greater safeguards for individuals”,surely

225
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,800
she expected it to protect the vulnerable
like Gary McKinnon, like Lauri Love?

226
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,450
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend campaigned
long and hard for Gary McKinnon, and I obviously

227
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,660
took that decision. At that time, it was for
the Home Secretary to decide whether there

228
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,420
was a human rights case for an individual
not to be extradited. We subsequently changed

229
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,840
the legal position on that, so this is now
a matter for the courts. There are certain

230
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,370
parameters that the courts look at in terms
of the extradition decision, and that is then

231
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,809
passed to the Home Secretary, but it is for
the courts to determine the human rights aspects

232
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:33,900
of any case that comes forward. It was right
to introduce the forum bar to ensure that

233
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:41,080
challenge on whether cases should be heard
here, but the legal process is very clear,

234
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,920
and the Home Secretary is part of it.

235
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:50,059
>>Vernon Coaker (Gedling) (Lab): What does
the Prime Minister say to British steelworkers

236
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,780
who have lost their jobs or whose jobs are
threatened, given the news that French steel

237
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:02,080
is to be used for the new replacement Trident
submarines? Is that what she means by being

238
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,620
a party of the workers?

239
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:15,070
>>The Prime Minister: We recognise the concerns
of British steelworkers. That is why the Government

240
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:23,090
have worked, under both my predecessor and
I, to ensure that we do what we can to promote,

241
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,340
encourage and retain a steel industry here
in the United Kingdom. A number of measures

242
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,929
have been taken. If the hon. Gentleman was
in the Chamber earlier for Scottish questions,

243
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:34,030
he will have heard my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Scotland setting them

244
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,030
out.

245
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,830
>>Mr Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con): Doctors
and nurses at Kettering general hospital are

246
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:46,741
treating a record number of patients with
increasingly world-class treatments, yet despite

247
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:53,340
being located in an area of rapid population
and housing growth, due to an historical anomaly

248
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,370
the local clinical commissioning groups are
among the most relatively underfunded in the

249
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,640
whole country. What can my right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister do to help address the

250
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
situation?

251
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,850
>>The Prime Minister: As my hon. Friend says,
we want to ensure that patients experience

252
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,570
the same high-quality care regardless of where
they live and wherever they are. That is why,

253
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,320
as I understand it, the funding for my hon.
Friend’s local clinical commissioning group

254
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:27,410
is being corrected to reflect more accurately
the local health need. An investment of more

255
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,910
than £757 million will be going into his
local area, which shows the Government’s

256
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,070
intention to ensure that we see a health service
that is working for everyone across the country,

257
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,060
but we can do that only with the economy to
back up the NHS.

258
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,200
>>Dr Alasdair McDonnell (Belfast South) (SDLP):
The Prime Minister will be aware that the

259
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,390
soft border between Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic was vital in boosting the economy

260
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:00,590
of Northern Ireland. Does she understand the
confusion that has set in, and that many of

261
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:07,590
us feel? On the one hand, the Government define
their intention tightly to control the free

262
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,970
movement of people and labour, yet on the
other they assure us that that border between

263
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:18,690
Northern Ireland and the Republic will continue
to be open. Does she see the contradiction

264
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,570
for many of those directly affected, and whose
jobs are affected?

265
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,910
>>The Prime Minister: I have been clear, the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has

266
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,860
been clear, and the Taoiseach has also said
that, on both sides of the border, we do not

267
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,750
want to see a return to the borders of the
past. It is worth reminding the House that

268
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,520
the common travel area has been in place since
the 1920s, so it was there well before we

269
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,020
were both members of the European Union. We
are working with the Government of the Republic,

270
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,679
and I have had discussions on this with the
First Minister and the Deputy First Minister

271
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,090
of Northern Ireland. We want to ensure that
we do not see a return to the borders of the

272
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,090
past.

273
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,540
>>Andrew Stephenson (Pendle) (Con): Thanks
to the Government’s growth deal, the £32

274
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,270
million transformation of Brierfield Mill
in my constituency gets under way this week,

275
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,960
giving a new lease of life to the largest
redundant mill complex in Lancashire. May

276
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,530
I thank the Prime Minister for her support
and commend Pendle’s other bits in the latest

277
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:22,860
round of the growth deal as a great way to
build a country that works for everyone?

278
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,560
>>The Prime Minister: I commend my hon. Friend
for taking his opportunity to support the

279
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:35,850
bids from Pendle. He is absolutely right that
the money put in has enabled growth in local

280
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,630
projects like Brierfield Mill to be unlocked.
We have seen £250 million committed to the

281
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,650
Lancashire local enterprise partnership, £2.8
billion to the northern powerhouse through

282
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,290
the local growth fund, and the latest round
of funding is worth up to £1.8 billion, with

283
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,260
good bids coming in from local LEPs. We are
assessing the proposals, including those from

284
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,690
Pendle. They will be looked at with the seriousness
my hon. Friend would expect.

285
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,970
>>Liz Saville Roberts (Dwyfor Meirionnydd)
(PC): This is the first Christmas that Hayley

286
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,450
Aldirmaz of Pwllheli will not see her husband
Hasan. They have been together for 10 years

287
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,011
and married for over four, with two young
children. It is evident that they are in a

288
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:18,600
long-term relationship, but Hayley’s Turkish
husband was refused a spouse visa in 2012

289
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,150
because she earns less than the Home Office
threshold of £18,600. Last year, half the

290
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:31,800
full-time workers of Dwyfor Meirionnydd earned
only £293 a week or less. This, I might say,

291
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,679
compares with the Prime Minister’s own constituency,
where the median salary was £571, or almost

292
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,780
£30,000 a year. Can the Prime Minister explain
why living in Dwyfor Meirionnydd means Hayley

293
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,120
has less chance of a proper family life, and
will she please help to unite the family this

294
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Christmas?

295
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,260
>>The Prime Minister: I will not comment on
the individual case. I know that the hon.

296
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,880
Lady sent me the details of this specific
case in writing. I will make sure that she

297
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,780
gets a full reply from the Immigration Minister.
On the broader issue she raises about the

298
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,090
income threshold for those wishing to join
a partner here in the United Kingdom, the

299
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,880
Government asked the independent Migration
Advisory Committee to advise on the level

300
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,900
of the income threshold. The committee suggested
a range of figures and we actually took the

301
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,390
lowest figure, £18,600, in that range. It
recommended that figure because it is the

302
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,170
level at which a British family generally
ceases to be able to access income-related

303
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:37,910
benefits, and is able to support themselves
and integrate into society. We believe it

304
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,130
is important that people coming here are able
to support themselves.

305
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:46,490
>>James Cartlidge (South Suffolk) (Con): My
constituents were delighted to learn this

306
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,510
week that Gainsborough’s House, a unique
museum and art gallery based in the very building

307
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,740
where Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, is
to receive almost £5 million of National

308
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,830
Lottery funding to become a national cultural
attraction. Will my right hon. Friend join

309
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,049
me in congratulating the director Mark Bills
and his team on their success, and does she

310
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:10,780
agree that if in Suffolk we are bold and positive
and go for devolution, we can look forward

311
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,400
to much more of this sort of transformative
investment in the years to come?

312
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,770
>>The Prime Minister: I join my hon. Friend
in commending all those who have been involved

313
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,820
in the bid at Gainsborough’s House. Many
people will enjoy visiting Gainsborough’s

314
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,690
House in the future as a result of the work
that will be able to be done. I know the importance

315
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,060
of the Heritage Lottery Fund. It supported
the excellent Stanley Spencer gallery in my

316
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,850
own constituency, so I have seen the impact
it can have. He is absolutely right. The point

317
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,390
about devolution deals is people coming together
with that ambition for their local area to

318
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,130
generate the transformative investment he
talks about. Suffolk is looking at the sort

319
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,330
of deal it might wish to have locally.

320
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:58,809
>>Mr Ben Bradshaw (Exeter) (Lab): With Russian
and Assad regime war planes bombing civilians

321
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,590
in Aleppo at an unprecedented rate, will the
Prime Minister join France in calling for

322
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,120
those responsible for these war crimes to
be referred to the International Criminal

323
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,910
Court? Will she re-examine, with allies, the
feasibility of a no-fly zone to protect the

324
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,850
Syrian people before it is too late?

325
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:22,570
>>The Prime Minister: We are very clear that
it is for the courts to decide where a war

326
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,360
crime is being committed. We co-sponsored
a UN Security Council resolution in May 2014

327
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,929
to refer those responsible for war crimes
and crimes against humanity in Syria, regardless

328
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,960
of affiliation, to the International Criminal
Court. Of course, that was vetoed by Russia

329
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,280
and China. On the issue of a no-fly zone,
this has been addressed. People have looked

330
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,130
at this over a number of years. The scenes
we see of the indiscriminate slaughter of

331
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,890
innocent civilians are absolutely appalling.
We want to see an end to that, but there are

332
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,570
many questions about a no-fly zone. Who is
it there to protect? Would it lead to Assad

333
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:05,240
bombing people in the expectation that they
would then move to that zone? How would a

334
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,250
safe area actually be enforced there? Who
would do that enforcement? There are many

335
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,480
questions that need to be looked at in those
sorts of issues. What we all know is that

336
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,780
the only real solution for peace and stability
in Syria is political transition, and it is

337
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:25,299
time Russia accepted that: that the future
of Syria is a political transition to a stable

338
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,299
Syria, free of Assad.

339
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:32,240
>>Fiona Bruce (Congleton) (Con): At Middlewich
High School in my constituency, the most vulnerable

340
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,240
pupils and their families are impressively
supported, pursuant to the school’s motto

341
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,679
of “Achievement for All”. Will the Prime
Minister confirm that under her plans for

342
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,500
education, and in a country that works for
everyone, parents can be assured that there

343
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,370
will be the right school place for their child,
whatever their ability?

344
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:57,980
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for the example she has given of the work

345
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,030
that is taking place in her constituency.
The whole aim of the Government’s education

346
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,669
policy is to increase the number of good school
places, so parents can have the confidence

347
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:12,250
that their child will have a good school place
and they will have the school place that is

348
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,500
right for them. That is why we want to see
universities more involved in schools, more

349
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:24,710
faith schools being opened up and the independent
sector helping the state sector where that

350
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,750
is sensible and its expertise can help. And
yes, we do want to lift the ban that currently

351
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,159
says that one type of good new school cannot
be opened. It is illegal to open a new good

352
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,100
school that is a selective school. We want
to remove that ban so that pupils of all abilities

353
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,110
get the opportunity.

354
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:47,950
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
The Prime Minister appears to have made a

355
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,950
choice, and that choice is to side with the
protectionists and nationalists who have taken

356
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:07,530
over her party, as surely as Momentum has
taken over the Labour party. She has chosen

357
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:13,750
a hard Brexit that was never on anybody’s
ballot paper and she has chosen to turn her

358
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:23,039
back on British business in the process. As
a result, petrol and food retailers have warned

359
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,039
of huge price rises at the pumps and on the
supermarket shelves in the coming days. When

360
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:37,640
will she put the interests of hard-working
British people ahead of an extremist protectionism

361
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,559
that absolutely nobody voted for?

362
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,861
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman asks
about who we are siding with. I will tell

363
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:50,120
him who this Government are siding with. We
are siding with the British people, who voted

364
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,850
to leave the European Union. It is high time
the hon. Gentleman listened to the vote of

365
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,030
the British people and accepted that that
is exactly what we are going to do.

366
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:07,590
>>Victoria Prentis (Banbury) (Con): Does the
Prime Minister share my sadness that the majority

367
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,679
of Banbury’s babies cannot currently be
delivered, as I was, in the Horton general

368
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:21,340
hospital? Will she join me in using any influence
and putting any pressure we can on the trust

369
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:28,110
to encourage it to recruit the obstetricians
we need to reopen our much valued unit?

370
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:35,159
>>The Prime Minister: I can say that I believe
every effort is being made to fill the vacant

371
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,070
obstetrics posts at the Horton general hospital.
I understand that those mothers who are having

372
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,890
a midwife-led delivery are still able to go
to the Horton general hospital, but others

373
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,580
have to go to the John Radcliffe hospital
in Oxford. Maternity services are important

374
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,230
to people and I believe the trust is actively
looking to ensure it can fill those posts.

375
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,760
What matters is a safe maternity service for
mother and baby.

376
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:11,299
>>Ms Angela Eagle (Wallasey) (Lab): Many people
across the House will be reassured that the

377
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:17,849
Government accepted the amendment to the Opposition
motion to be debated later this afternoon

378
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:24,469
that guarantees that this House is able properly
to scrutinise the plan for leaving the European

379
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:30,960
Union before article 50 is invoked. Can she
tell us: will that scrutiny involve a vote?

380
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,519
>>The Prime Minister: I have to say to the
hon. Lady that the idea that Parliament was

381
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:51,709
somehow not going to be able to discuss, debate
or question issues around Brexit is, frankly,

382
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,560
completely wrong. Let me provide her with
some examples. The Secretary of State for

383
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,130
Exiting the European Union has already made
two statements—and I believe four hours

384
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,119
of questions followed from those. A new Select
Committee has been set up, which crucially

385
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,319
includes representatives from all parts of
the United Kingdom to look at these issues.

386
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,579
Only just over a week ago, I announced that
there will be a great repeal Bill in the next

387
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,999
Session to repeal the European Communities
Act 1972. Parliament will thus have every

388
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:25,549
opportunity to debate this issue.

389
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:34,260
>>Will Quince (Colchester) (Con): Every year
in the UK, 3,500 babies are still-born, and

390
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,880
I commend the Government for setting the target
of a 20% reduction by the end of this Parliament

391
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,559
and a 50% reduction by 2030. Does the Prime
Minister agree that in Baby Loss Awareness

392
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:48,979
Week we must do all we can to provide the
best-quality bereavement care for those parents

393
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,249
who sadly lose a baby?

394
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:56,619
>>The Prime Minister: I think my hon. Friend
is absolutely right, and I am pleased to say

395
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,660
that the Health Secretary will attend the
Baby Loss Awareness Week reception, which

396
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,469
will be held in Parliament immediately after
today’s Prime Minister’s Questions. I

397
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:09,569
encourage other Members to attend it, too.
My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the

398
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:14,789
loss of a baby must be absolutely devastating;
I am aware that some people sitting in this

399
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:20,650
Chamber have been through that tragedy in
their lives. What is absolutely essential

400
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:28,130
is that the best possible bereavement care
be given to parents at this tragic moment

401
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,910
in their lives when they are at their most
vulnerable. That is why we have provided money

402
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:37,740
to introduce dedicated bereavement rooms at
40 hospitals, as well as investing more in

403
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,349
improving birthing facilities, which are also
important. Care and counsel for people who

404
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:48,940
have lost a baby is essential; I think we
all accept that.

405
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,660
>>Stella Creasy (Walthamstow) (Lab/Co-op):
On 2 July, the Home Office was given details

406
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,469
of the 178 children who are still stuck in
the Calais refugee camp, but who had a legal

407
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:06,640
right to be here in the UK with their families
to keep them safe and protected. Given the

408
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,059
delays in acting, what responsibility does
the Prime Minister think this Government have

409
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:15,589
to the 18 of those children who have now gone
missing?

410
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:22,059
>>The Prime Minister: Far from not acting,
this Government have been working with the

411
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,710
French Government on dealing with those who
are in the camps. We have put extra resource

412
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:33,729
into speeding up the process of dealing with
the claims of the unaccompanied children,

413
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:39,440
making that process faster and quicker, with
more children coming here as a result. That

414
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,279
is alongside all the other work we are doing
in relation to refugees and unaccompanied

415
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:51,410
minors. Crucially, of course, we are also
working to ensure that we deal with the traffickers

416
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,869
and the smugglers who are often in the camps;
we need to make sure that they do not have

417
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:02,120
access to children in the future. We have
speeded up the process and more children are

418
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,190
coming here as a result.

419
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,950
>>Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) (Con): Tomorrow
is secondary breast cancer awareness day,

420
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,069
and I would like to ask the Prime Minister
to join me in wishing these men and women

421
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:18,349
well. Currently, only a third of NHS trusts
collect the data in this area. Does my right

422
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:23,710
hon. Friend agree that better data collection
can inform diagnosis, treatment and the use

423
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:28,309
of NHS resources across the piece and give
better outcomes for all patients?

424
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:34,630
>>The Prime Minister: I entirely accept my
hon. Friend’s point that better information

425
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,960
provides greater opportunity to address these
issues. I join her in commending and wishing

426
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,930
well all those—as she says, both men and
women—who have suffered from breast cancer

427
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:55,559
and who have come through that, as I know
my hon. Friend has. Other Members and so many

428
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,380
people across the country are in the same
position; it is important that they receive

429
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,140
the right care so that they can come through
that and see a bright future.

430
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:09,690
>>Alison McGovern (Wirral South) (Lab): Last
night, a huge number of MPs presented in this

431
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,920
House WASPI—Women Against State Pension
Inequality—petitions from towns up and down

432
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,250
the country, so will the Prime Minister now
commit to overturning those mistaken arrangements

433
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,450
of 2011 and provide justice and transitional
arrangements for WASPI women?

434
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,091
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady should
know that transitional arrangements are already

435
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:32,821
in place. We did make changes. We committed
£1 billion to lessen the impact of the state

436
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:36,359
pension age changes on those who were affected,
so that no one would experience a change of

437
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,039
more than 18 months. In fact, 81% of women’s
state pension ages will increase by no more

438
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,099
than 12 months, compared to the previous timetable.
The Department for Work and Pensions informed

439
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,140
people of the change in the state pension
age after the changes that were made in 2011.

440
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,989
Moreover, in the future women will gain from
the new pension arrangements that are being

441
00:39:53,989 --> 00:40:00,009
introduced. Women’s pensions are a long-standing
issue, but there will be better pension arrangements

442
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:02,609
for them in the future because of the changes
that the Government have made.

443
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:07,670
>>Rishi Sunak (Richmond (Yorks)) (Con): I
gather that the Prime Minister made Chancellor

444
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,280
Merkel a gift of Wainwright’s “Coast to
Coast Walk”, which describes the fabulous

445
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,970
walk that runs through my constituency. Is
she aware that the “coast to coast” is

446
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,369
not, in fact, an official national trail,
and will she meet me to discuss my campaign

447
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,769
to give this national treasure its deserved
national status?

448
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:33,520
>>The Prime Minister: As my hon. Friend knows,
I enjoy walking as well. There are some fantastic

449
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,259
walks across the United Kingdom. I have not
yet done the “coast to coast” myself,

450
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:43,739
however; there is not much time for me to
do it at the moment. My hon. Friend probably

451
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:50,009
knows that the decision about the designation
of the “coast to coast” is more appropriately

452
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:53,930
one for Natural England, and I am sure that
he will do all he can to lobby Natural England

453
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,630
on the issue.
