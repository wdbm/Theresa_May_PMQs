1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,300
>>Toby Perkins (Chesterfield) (Lab): If she
will list her official engagements for Wednesday

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,460
8 February.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,570
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,410
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,830
later today.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,420
>>Toby Perkins: The Government chose to launch
the pupil premium at Spire Junior School in

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,090
Chesterfield, where 70% of pupils receive
free school meals. The headteacher, Dave Shaw,

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,490
was going to run the great north run for a
cancer charity. However, the Prime Minister’s

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:44,300
new schools funding formula means that Spire
Junior School now faces the biggest cuts in

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,931
all of Derbyshire. Running for cash is now
the only alternative to sacking staff. Will

11
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:55,980
she go to the finish line and tell Dave Shaw
how this is a fairer funding formula?

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,460
>>The Prime Minister
I am pleased to say that, in the local authority

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,130
that covers the hon. Gentleman’s constituency,
we have seen an increase of over 17,000 children

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,770
at good or outstanding schools since 2010.
That is down to Government changes and the

15
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,859
hard work of teachers and other staff in the
schools. For a very long time, it has been

16
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:25,369
the general view—I have campaigned on this
for a long time—that we need to see a fairer

17
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:34,659
funding formula for schools. What the Government
have brought forward is a consultation on

18
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,170
a fairer funding formula. We will look at
the results of that fairer funding formula

19
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,299
and will bring forward our firm proposals
in due course.

20
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:49,469
>>Johnny Mercer (Plymouth, Moor View) (Con):
Over the last 12 months, as a member of the

21
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,579
Defence Committee, I have had the opportunity
to look into the Iraq Historic Allegations

22
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,770
Team and how we as a country more broadly
deal with historical allegations against our

23
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,574
servicemen and women. This has been a deeply
disturbing experience not only for those of

24
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,574
us who have served, but for many Members across
the House. I know that the Prime Minister

25
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:12,140
gets this, but will she commit to redouble
her and her Government’s efforts to get

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,690
a grip on this historical allegations process
so that never again will our servicemen and

27
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,820
women be exposed to the likes of Phil Shiner?

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,299
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure the whole
House will want to join me in praising the

29
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:34,021
bravery and commitment of all those who serve
in our armed forces. I thank my hon. Friend

30
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,950
for the work that he is doing on the Defence
Committee, because, of course, he brings personal

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,079
expertise to that work. Those who serve on
the frontline deserve our support when they

32
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:49,629
get home, and I can assure him of the Government’s
commitment to that. All troops facing allegations

33
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:52,840
receive legal aid from the Government, with
the guarantee that it will not be claimed

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,569
back. In relation to IHAT, which he specifically
referred to, we are committed to reducing

35
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:05,370
its case load to a small number of credible
cases as quickly as possible. On the action

36
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,299
that has been taken in relation to the individual
he has referred to, I think it is absolutely

37
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:19,150
appalling when people try to make a business
out of chasing after our brave troops.

38
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:32,640
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): Nine
out of 10 NHS trusts say their hospitals have

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,290
been at unsafe levels of overcrowding. One
in six accident and emergency units in England

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,680
is set to be closed or downgraded. Could the
Prime Minister please explain how closing

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,280
A&E departments will tackle overcrowding and
ever-growing waiting lists?

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,469
>>The Prime Minister: First, I extend my thanks
and, I am sure, those of the whole House to

43
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:04,790
the hard-working staff in the NHS, who do
a great job day in and day out treating patients.

44
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:15,189
Yes, we recognise there are heavy pressures
on the NHS. That is why, this year, we are

45
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:22,800
funding the NHS at £1.3 billion more than
the Labour party promised at the last election.

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,090
The right hon. Gentleman refers specifically
to accident and emergency. What is our response

47
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,530
in accident and emergency? We see 600 more
A&E consultants, 1,500 more A&amp;E doctors

48
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,900
and 2,000 more paramedics. It is not about
standing up, making a soundbite and asking

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,400
a question; it is about delivering results,
and that is what this Conservative Government

50
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,350
are doing.

51
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:53,740
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Congratulating A&E staff
is one thing; paying them properly is another.

52
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,520
I hope the Prime Minister managed to see the
BBC report on the Royal Blackburn A&E department,

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:09,340
which showed that people had to wait up to
13 hours and 52 minutes to be seen. A major

54
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:17,470
cause of the pressure on A&amp;Es is the £4.6
billion cut in the social care budget since

55
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:28,840
2010. Earlier this week, Liverpool’s very
esteemed adult social 

56
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,880
care director, Samih Kalakeche, resigned,
saying:

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:44,039
“Frankly I can’t see social services surviving
after two years. That’s the absolute maximum...

58
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,690
people are suffering, and we are really only
seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

59
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:58,120
What advice do the Government have for the
people of Liverpool in this situation?

60
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,280
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon.—[Interruption.]

61
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,569
>>Mr Speaker: Order. It is bad enough when
Members who are within the curtilage of the

62
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:12,940
Chamber shout; those who are not absolutely
should not do so. It is a discourtesy to the

63
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,050
House of Commons—nothing more, nothing less.
Please do not do it.

64
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:27,840
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
referred at an early stage of his question

65
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,680
to Blackburn. I am happy to say that compared
to 2010 there are 129 more hospital doctors

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,800
and 413 more nurses in Blackburn’s East
Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust. He then went

67
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,610
on to talk about waiting times. Waiting times
can be an issue. Where is it that you wait

68
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:55,160
a week longer for pneumonia treatment, a week
longer for heart disease treatment, seven

69
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,460
weeks longer for cataract treatment, 11 weeks
longer for hernia treatment, and 21 weeks

70
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:13,750
longer for a hip operation? It is not in England—it
is in Wales. Who is in power in Wales? Labour.

71
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:21,060
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was about the
comments from Samih Kalakeche in Liverpool

72
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,490
and why the people of Liverpool are having
to suffer these great cuts. Liverpool has

73
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,949
asked to meet the Government on four occasions.

74
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,310
The crisis is so bad that until yesterday
David Hodge, the Conservative leader of Surrey

75
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:44,590
County Council, planned to hold a referendum
for a 15% increase in council tax. At the

76
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:54,150
last minute, it was called off. Can the Prime
Minister tell the House whether or not a special

77
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,530
deal was done for Surrey?

78
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,950
>>The Prime Minister: The decision as to whether
or not to hold a referendum in Surrey is entirely

79
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:10,860
a matter for the local authority in Surrey—Surrey
County Council.

80
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,099
The right hon. Gentleman raised the issue
of social care, which we have exchanged on

81
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:20,750
across this Dispatch Box before. As I have
said before, we do need to find a long-term,

82
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,759
sustainable solution for social care in this
country. I recognise the short-term pressures.

83
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,939
That is why we have enabled local authorities
to put more money into social care. We have

84
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,729
provided more money. Over the next two years,
£900 million more will be available for social

85
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,820
care. But we also need to look at ensuring
that good practice is spread across the whole

86
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:49,160
country. We can look at places such as Barnsley,
North Tyneside, St Helens and Rutland. Towards

87
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,950
the end of last year, there were virtually
no delayed discharges attributable to social

88
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,000
care in those councils. But we also need to
look long term. That is why the Cabinet Office

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
is driving a review, with the relevant Departments,
to find a sustainable solution, which the

90
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,540
Labour party ducked for far too long.

91
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,990
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was whether there
had been a special deal done for Surrey. The

92
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,640
leader said that they had had many conversations
with the Government. We know they have, because

93
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,810
I have been leaked copies of texts sent by
the Tory leader, David Hodge, intended for

94
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,330
somebody called “Nick” who works for Ministers
in the Department for Communities and Local

95
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,680
Government. One of the texts reads:

96
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:40,180
“I am advised that DCLG officials have been
working on a solution and you will be contacting

97
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,790
me to agree a memorandum of understanding.”

98
00:09:46,790 --> 00:10:00,040
Will the Government now publish this memorandum
of understanding, and while they are about

99
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,830
it, will all councils be offered the same
deal?

100
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:11,820
>>The Prime Minister: What we have given all
councils is the opportunity to raise a 3%

101
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,450
precept on council tax, to go into social
care. The right hon. Gentleman talks about

102
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,970
understanding. What the Labour party fails
to understand—[Interruption.]

103
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:29,339
>>Mr Speaker: Order. There is far too much
noise. Mr Pound, calm yourself—you are supposed

104
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:42,589
to be a senior statesman—and Mr Rotheram,
you should reserve your shouting for the stands

105
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:43,660
at Anfield.

106
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,769
>>The Prime Minister: As I say, all councils
have the opportunity to raise the 3% precept,

107
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,920
to put that funding into the provision of
social care. What the Labour party fails to

108
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,690
understand is that this is not just a question
of looking at money; it is a question of looking

109
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,670
at spreading best practice and finding a sustainable
solution. I have to say to the right hon.

110
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,640
Gentleman that if we look at social care provision
across the entire country, we will see that

111
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,149
the last thing that social care providers
need is another one of Labour’s bouncing

112
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,209
cheques.

113
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,690
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I wonder if this has anything
to do with the fact that the Chancellor and

114
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,649
the Health Secretary both represent Surrey
constituencies.

115
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:39,620
There was a second text from the Surrey County
Council leader to “Nick”. It says:

116
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:47,010
“The numbers you indicated are the numbers
I understand are acceptable for me to accept

117
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,160
and call off the R”.

118
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,329
I have been reading a bit of John le Carré
and apparently “R” means “referendum”—it

119
00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:02,709
is very subtle, all this. He goes on to say
in his text to “Nick”:

120
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:10,760
“If it is possible for that info to be sent
to myself I can then revert back soonest,

121
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,930
really want to kill this off”.

122
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:22,970
So, how much did the Government offer Surrey
to “kill this off”, and is the same sweetheart

123
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:31,000
deal on offer to every council facing the
social care crisis created by this Government?

124
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,079
>>The Prime Minister: I have made clear to
the right hon. Gentleman what has been made

125
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,769
available to every council, which is the ability
to raise the precept. I have to say to him—[Interruption.]

126
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:50,260
>>Mr Speaker: Order. As colleagues know, I
never mind how long Prime Minister’s questions

127
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,949
take. The questions and the answers must be
heard.

128
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,860
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
comes to the Dispatch Box making all sorts

129
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:14,230
of claims. Yet again, what we get from Labour
is alternative facts; what it really needs

130
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,829
is an alternative leader.

131
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:29,750
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was, what deal
was offered to Surrey that got it to call

132
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,709
off a referendum, and will the same deal be
offered to every other council going through

133
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,540
a social care crisis?

134
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,880
Hospital wards are overcrowded, a million
people are not getting the care they need,

135
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,530
and family members, mostly women, are having
to give up work to care for loved ones. Every

136
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:58,860
day that the Prime Minister fails to act,
this crisis gets worse. Will she finally come

137
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:06,040
clean and provide local authorities with the
funding they need to fund social care properly,

138
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,339
so that our often elderly and vulnerable people
can be treated with the support and dignity

139
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,889
that they deserve in a civilised society?

140
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:20,850
>>The Prime Minister: The deal that is on
offer to all councils is the one that I have

141
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:28,630
already set out. Let me be very clear with
the right hon. Gentleman. As ever, he stands

142
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:36,259
up and consistently asks for more spending,
more money, more funding. What he always fails

143
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:44,030
to recognise is that you can spend money on
social care and the national health service

144
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:50,980
only if you have a strong economy to deliver
the wealth that you need. There is a fundamental

145
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,009
difference between us. When I talk—[Interruption.]

146
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:58,320
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I am sorry, but there
is still too much noise in the Chamber. People

147
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
observing our proceedings, both here and outside,
want the questions heard and the answers heard,

148
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
and they will be.

149
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,820
>>The Prime Minister: There is a difference
between us. When I talk about half a trillion

150
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,391
pounds, it is about the money we will be spending
on the NHS this Parliament. When Labour Members

151
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:20,959
talk about half a trillion pounds, it is about
the money they want to borrow: Conservatives

152
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,430
investing in the NHS; Labour bankrupting Britain.

153
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:34,870
>>Scott Mann (North Cornwall) (Con): Significant
challenges face this great nation of ours,

154
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,180
Prime Minister, one of which is tackling mental
health, particularly for young people. The

155
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,780
pressures of juggling school life and family
life, and of staying safe and feeling valued

156
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,930
online, are more difficult than ever. Will
the Prime Minister meet me and my team to

157
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,829
discuss the mental health app we have been
working on and developing to give young people

158
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,500
a toolbox to help them in their times of crisis?

159
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,931
>>The Prime Minister: I am very interested
to hear of the important work my hon. Friend

160
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:09,579
is doing in that important area. As he knows,
I think we need to put more of a focus on

161
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,319
mental health and make progress. I am pleased
to say that something like 1,400 more people

162
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:18,639
are accessing mental health services every
day. That is an advance, but more needs to

163
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,050
be done. We are putting more money—£68
million—into improving mental healthcare

164
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,990
through digital innovation, which sounds as
if it fits right into what he is looking at.

165
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,270
There will be a focus on that with children’s
and young people’s mental health in mind.

166
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,490
He might want to look out for the Department
of Health and Department for Education joint

167
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,079
Green Paper on that, which they will publish
in October.

168
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:47,730
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): Last night,
parliamentarians from across the Chamber and

169
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:54,220
across the parties voted overwhelmingly against
the UK Government’s Brexit plans—in the

170
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:03,889
Scottish Parliament. If the United Kingdom
is a partnership of equals, will the Prime

171
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:10,200
Minister compromise like the Scottish Government
and reach a negotiated agreement before invoking

172
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,770
article 50, or will she just carry on regardless?

173
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:24,340
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, when the UK Government negotiate, we

174
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,800
will negotiate as the Government for the whole
United Kingdom. We have put in place the Joint

175
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,340
Ministerial Committee arrangements through
various committees, which enable us to work

176
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:43,090
closely with the devolved Administrations
to identify the particular issues they want

177
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,860
represented as we put our views together.
We have said that we will intensify the discussions

178
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,220
within that JMC arrangement, and that is exactly
what we will be doing.

179
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,520
>>Angus Robertson: When the Prime Minister
was in Edinburgh on 15 July last year, she

180
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:09,950
pledged that she would not trigger article
50 until she had an agreed UK-wide approach.

181
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,070
Given that the Scottish Parliament has voted
overwhelmingly against her approach, and that

182
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,690
all bar one MP representing a Scottish constituency
in the House of Commons has voted against

183
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:31,430
her approach, she does not have an agreed
UK-wide approach. As the Prime Minister knows,

184
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:38,040
a lot of people in Scotland watch Prime Minister’s
questions. Will she tell those viewers in

185
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,200
Scotland whether she intends to keep her word
to Scotland or not?

186
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,340
>>The Prime Minister: We are ensuring that
we are working closely with the Scottish Government,

187
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,420
and indeed with the other devolved Administrations,
as we take this matter forward. I would just

188
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,100
remind the right hon. Gentleman of two things.
First, the Supreme Court was very clear that

189
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,950
the Scottish Parliament does not have a veto
on the triggering of article 50—the European

190
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,090
Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which
is going through the House, obviously gives

191
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:14,310
the power to the Government to trigger article
50. I would also remind him of this point,

192
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,950
because he constantly refers to the interests
of Scotland inside the European Union: an

193
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,340
independent Scotland would not be in the European
Union.

194
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:30,590
>>Jake Berry (Rossendale and Darwen) (Con):
The people of Rossendale and Darwen warmly

195
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,461
welcome the Government’s housing White Paper.
Will my right hon. Friend confirm that, when

196
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:42,550
it comes to providing more security for renters,
building more affordable homes and helping

197
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:49,330
people to buy their own home, this party—the
Conservative party—is fixing our broken

198
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,540
housing market?

199
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,220
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to agree
with my hon. Friend. Our broken housing market

200
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,450
is one of the greatest barriers to progress
in Britain today, and the excellent housing

201
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,010
White Paper brought out by my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Communities and

202
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,440
Local Government sets out the steps we will
take to fix it. My hon. Friend is right: it

203
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,580
is the Conservatives in government who will
support local authorities to deliver more

204
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,230
of the right homes in the right places, to
encourage faster build-out of developments—I

205
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,230
am sure everybody recognises the problem of
planning permissions that are given and then

206
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,930
not built out—and to create the conditions
for a more competitive and diverse housing

207
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,700
market. We are calling for action and we are
setting out the responsibilities of all parties

208
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,810
in building the homes that Britain needs.

209
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:41,770
>>Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP): Does
the Prime Minister agree that in a 21st-century

210
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,140
Parliament the rules should not enable any
Member to speak for 58 minutes in a three-hour

211
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,560
debate? Does she agree that the rules of the
House should be changed to prevent filibustering

212
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:58,060
and ensure that Members on both sides of the
House get a fair share of the time available?

213
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,290
>>The Prime Minister: I find that a rather
curious question from the hon. Gentleman.

214
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:12,620
As it happens, last night I was out of the
House between the two votes. I switched on

215
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:21,730
the BBC parliamentary channel and I saw the
hon. Gentleman speaking. I turned over to

216
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,060
something else. I switched back to the parliamentary
channel and he was still speaking. I switched

217
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:39,200
over to something else. I switched back and
he was still speaking. He is the last person

218
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:47,530
to complain about filibustering in this House.
[Interruption.]

219
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:56,120
>>Mr Speaker: Order. Mr Docherty-Hughes, you
seem to be in a state of permanent over-excitement.

220
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,810
Calm yourself, man. Take some sort of medicament
and it will soothe you. We must hear Mrs Villiers.

221
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,370
>>Mrs Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con):
As we prepare in this House to take back control

222
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:13,830
over our laws on agriculture, will the Prime
Minister agree to use Brexit as an opportunity

223
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,170
to strengthen, not weaken, the rules that
safeguard the welfare of animals?

224
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:25,280
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
raises an important point that is, I know,

225
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,230
of concern to many people in the House and
outside. We should be proud that in the UK

226
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,470
we have some of the highest animal welfare
standards in the world—indeed, one of the

227
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,850
highest scores for animal protection in the
world. Leaving the EU will not change that.

228
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:46,130
I can assure her that we are committed to
maintaining and, where possible, improving

229
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,510
standards of welfare in the UK, while ensuring
of course that our industry is not put at

230
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,750
a competitive disadvantage.

231
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,550
>>Gavin Newlands (Paisley and Renfrewshire
North) (SNP): Last week, the Russian Duma

232
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,800
shamefully decriminalised domestic violence
committed against women and children. Given

233
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,380
the Prime Minister’s new global Britain
approach, I trust that the Government will

234
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,350
encourage Russia to rethink that regressive
approach, which trivialises domestic violence.

235
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,230
Does she agree that ratifying the Istanbul
convention would send a message to Russia

236
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,190
and the world about the priority that should
be placed on ending gender-based violence?

237
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:24,210
>>The Prime Minister: I am proud that in this
country we have strengthened the law on domestic

238
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,530
violence and violence against women and girls.
We see this as a retrograde step by the Russian

239
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:35,850
Government. Repealing existing legislation
sends out the wrong message on what is a global

240
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,013
problem. We have joined others in the Council
of Europe and the Organisation for Security

241
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:41,850
and Co-operation in Europe in criticising
that decision.

242
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:50,070
>>Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con):
Each year, the NHS reportedly spends £80

243
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,720
million more than it needs to on prescriptions
for basic painkillers that can be sourced

244
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,970
much more cheaply, but at the same time secondary
breast cancer patients face being denied life-extending

245
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,602
drugs such as Kadcyla by the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence. Will my right

246
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:12,400
hon. Friend review that poor allocation of
resources and give breast cancer sufferers

247
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,680
the hope that they deserve?

248
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,900
>>The Prime Minister: This is obviously a
very important issue that my hon. Friend has

249
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,020
raised. I understand that on the point of
basic medication it is not the fact that the

250
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,030
NHS pays more for basic painkillers than on
the high street: in fact, its prices are lower.

251
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,670
In the case of Kadcyla and similar drugs,
it is right that difficult decisions are made

252
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,400
on the basis of clinical evidence. I understand
that NICE is undertaking a comprehensive assessment

253
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,520
before making a final recommendation, and
in the meantime Kadcyla is still available

254
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
to patients.

255
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,430
>>Tom Elliott (Fermanagh and South Tyrone)
(UUP): Last month, Sir Anthony Hart published

256
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:55,810
his report on historical institutional abuse
in Northern Ireland. Given the uncertain political

257
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,490
situation with the Northern Ireland political
institutions, if the Executive is not up and

258
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,410
running within a month, will the Prime Minister
commit to implementing the report in full?

259
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:15,200
>>The Prime Minister: This was obviously an
important review. We have our own inquiry

260
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:25,210
into historic child abuse in England and Wales.
I recognise the hon. Gentleman’s point about

261
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,060
looking ahead to the future. The elections
in Northern Ireland will take place on 2 March.

262
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,890
There will then be a limited period for an
Executive to be put together. I fervently

263
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:42,280
hope an Executive can be put together to maintain
the devolved institutions, and I encourage

264
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,980
all parties to work very hard to ensure that.
I do not want the benefits of progress to

265
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:53,670
be undone, but I am sure, looking ahead, that
whatever is necessary will be done to ensure

266
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,960
that the findings of the report are taken
into account and acted on.

267
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
>>James Morris (Halesowen and Rowley Regis)
(Con): The Prime Minister has been crystal

268
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,370
clear on her negotiating objectives as we
prepare to leave the European Union. Does

269
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:16,850
she agree that regions like the west midlands,
part of which I represent, need a voice in

270
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:24,090
the negotiations to ensure we take the opportunities
presented by Brexit to raise investment in

271
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:30,630
education, skills and infrastructure and to
ensure that her vision of a global Britain

272
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,660
represents the interests of all the regions
of England, as well as the broader United

273
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
Kingdom?

274
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,730
>>The Prime Minister: I agree with my hon.
Friend. When we negotiate as a United Kingdom,

275
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,480
we will be negotiating for the whole of the
United Kingdom and taking account of all parts

276
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,030
of the United Kingdom. We have a real ambition
to make the west midlands an engine for growth.

277
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,340
That is about growing the region’s economy
and more jobs. Money has been put into growth

278
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,122
deal funding and, for example, the Birmingham
rail hub. The west midlands will of course

279
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:05,950
be getting a strong voice nationally with
a directly elected Mayor in May. I believe

280
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,113
Andy Street, with both local expertise and
business experience, will be a very good Mayor

281
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,113
for the west midlands.

282
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:14,640
>>Mr Speaker: I welcome the hon. Gentleman
back again to the Chamber.

283
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:23,570
>>Mr Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley) (Lab)
I’m looking pretty slim as well, Mr Speaker!

284
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,870
I had five months of NHS treatment at the
Newcastle Royal Victoria infirmary under the

285
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:37,740
auspices of Professor Griffin, a marvellous
surgeon. Seeing as I might have come out with

286
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:46,210
palliative care, I think he has just about
saved my life. That is the best side of the

287
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:54,700
NHS. The service I received was absolutely
wonderful, but there is a flip side. What

288
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:03,390
we have today is what are called “corridor
nurses”, who look after patients on trolleys

289
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,950
in corridors. Quite honestly, Prime Minister,
that is not the way we want the health service

290
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,090
to be run. We want it to be run in the way
it saved me. Get your purse open and give

291
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,980
them the money they want.

292
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,530
>>The Prime Minister: As Mr Speaker said,
I welcome the hon. Gentleman back to his place

293
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:28,430
in the Chamber. I commend the surgeon and
all those in the national health service who

294
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,150
treated him and enabled him to be here today
and continue his duties. There are, as we

295
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:39,770
know, surgeons, doctors, nurses and other
staff up and down the NHS day in, day out

296
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:46,090
saving lives. We should commend them for all
they do. The north-east is a very good example

297
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,560
of some of the really good practice in the
NHS. I want to see that good practice spread

298
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,970
across the NHS in the whole country.

299
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,950
>>Dr Sarah Wollaston (Totnes) (Con): I am
not alone in hearing from families long-settled

300
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,400
here in Britain who are deeply worried that
they could be separated after we leave the

301
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,640
European Union. I know the Prime Minister
will not want that to happen. Will she reassure

302
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,330
all our constituents today that those who
were born elsewhere in the European Union

303
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:23,980
but settled here in the UK, married or in
partnerships with British citizens will have

304
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,050
the right to remain?

305
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:30,490
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend obviously
raises an issue that is of concern all across

306
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,140
this House. As she says, it is of concern
to many individuals outside the House who

307
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,360
want reassurance about their future. As I
have said, I want to be able to give, and

308
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,260
I expect to be able to give, that reassurance,
but I want to see the same reassurance for

309
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,450
UK citizens living in the EU. What I can say
to her is that when I trigger article 50,

310
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,500
I intend to make it clear that I want this
to be a priority for an early stage of the

311
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,880
negotiations, so we can address this issue
and give reassurance to the people concerned.

312
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,030
>>Dawn Butler (Brent Central) (Lab): Just
two weeks ago, Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes, 15

313
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:17,080
years old, left school, was stabbed four times
and died. Three days earlier, Djodjo Nsaka,

314
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:25,070
19 years old, was stabbed to death in Wembley.
Just a few months earlier, two of my young

315
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,070
constituents, James Owusu-Ajyekum, 22 years
old, and Oliver Tetlow, 27 years old, were

316
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:36,350
killed in what the police say was a case of
mistaken identity. Next week, I am meeting

317
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,500
the deputy Mayor of London to discuss this
and other issues. Will the Prime Minister

318
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,660
meet me, fellow MPs and my borough commander
to talk about this issue and the Sycamore

319
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,220
project, which we would like rolled out in
London and beyond?

320
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:58,570
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I send the
condolences of the whole House to the families

321
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:05,160
and friends of all those the hon. Lady refers
to who were brutally stabbed and attacked

322
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:15,140
in knife attacks? This is obviously an important
issue, particularly in London, and we want

323
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,370
it addressed. A lot of good work has been
done. I am not aware of the Sycamore project,

324
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,860
but I would be happy to hear more details
of it.

325
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:28,950
>>James Berry (Kingston and Surbiton) (Con):
From medics at Kingston hospital to researchers

326
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,130
at Kingston University and the staff at growing
electronics businesses such as Genuine Solutions,

327
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,190
Kingston’s workforce is enriched by highly
skilled workers from abroad, so will my right

328
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,770
hon. Friend confirm that, after we leave the
EU, we will continue to welcome highly skilled

329
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,810
workers from the EU and beyond?

330
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:56,190
>>The Prime Minister: We have been very clear
that we want to bring the net migration numbers

331
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,340
down, but we also want to ensure that the
brightest and the best are still welcome here

332
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,970
in the UK. That is why people want to see
the UK Government making decisions about people

333
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:12,892
coming here from the EU. We are clear, however,
as I said in my Lancaster House speech, that

334
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:17,490
there will still be immigration from the EU
into the UK. We want to ensure that the brightest

335
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,120
and the best can come here.

336
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,770
>>Liz Kendall (Leicester West) (Lab): Yesterday,
the Brexit Minister claimed that Parliament

337
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:32,270
would have a meaningful vote on the final
EU deal. Will the Prime Minister confirm that,

338
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,340
under her plans, Parliament will either have
to accept what the Government offer or fall

339
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,550
back on World Trade Organisation rules and
that, in the event of no deal, there will

340
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,670
be no vote at all? In reality, is this not
just a case of take it or leave it? It is

341
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,460
not a meaningful concession; it is a con.

342
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,420
>>The Prime Minister: We have been clear on
this, but I am happy to reiterate what the

343
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,000
Minister said yesterday. We have looked at
this matter. I said in my Lancaster House

344
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,190
speech that there would be a vote on the final
deal, but there were a number of questions

345
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,570
about what exactly that meant. We will bring
forward a motion; the motion will be on the

346
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,150
final agreement; it will be for approval by
both Houses of Parliament; it will be before

347
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:20,020
the final agreement is concluded, and we expect—I
know that this has been an issue for several

348
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:26,280
right hon. and hon. Members—and intend that
that will happen before the European Parliament

349
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,250
debates and votes on the final agreement.

350
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,310
>>Mr Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale West)
(Con): The Prime Minister knows that Trafford

351
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:40,420
schools are the best in the country, but they
are also in one of f40’s worst-funded areas.

352
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,910
Perversely, the draft funding formula would
actually cut funding to Trafford schools,

353
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:53,350
not increase it. When she reviews the draft
proposals, will she please look for a new

354
00:33:53,350 --> 00:34:00,270
formula that guarantees that all the worst-funded
areas see an increase in funding, not a cut?

355
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:07,010
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important matter that is on the minds of

356
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,530
a number of right hon. and hon. Friends. As
I said earlier, the current system of funding

357
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:20,550
is unfair, not transparent and out of date.
I want a system that supports our aspiration

358
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,120
to ensure that every child has a good school
place. In looking at these reforms, I can

359
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,000
assure my hon. Friend that we want to get
this right, which is why we are consulting

360
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,010
and why we will look closely at the responses
to the consultation.

361
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:39,950
>>Caroline Flint (Don Valley) (Lab): Npower
has announced a 9.8% increase on dual fuel

362
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,949
bills, which even the former boss of Npower,
Paul Massara, has described as “shocking”.

363
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,668
EDF has announced an 8.4% electricity hike,
and it is reported that British Gas is preparing

364
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:56,658
its 11 million customers for a 9% increase.
Ofgem has moved to protect those who are on

365
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:02,030
prepayment meters with a cap on their energy
bills, so why does the Prime Minister not

366
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,540
demand similar protection for the majority
of customers, who are being ripped off, as

367
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,590
the Competition and Markets Authority has
said, to the sum of £1.4 billion a year?

368
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:16,710
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Lady
may have missed the fact that we have said

369
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,960
that where we think markets are not working,
we will look at any measures that are needed—and

370
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,920
the energy market is one of those we are looking
at the moment.

371
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,970
>>Karl MᶜCartney (Lincoln) (Con): In the
spirit of neutrality, the Prime Minister’s

372
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,920
Lancaster House speech last month was a rallying
call to put the divisions of the referendum

373
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,480
behind us and to unite behind a bold vision
for a stronger, fairer more global Britain.

374
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,870
Does my right hon. Friend agree with me that
this is a vision that every Member should

375
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,760
support, because the more united we are, the
stronger our negotiating hand will be—[Interruption.]

376
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,020
>>Mr Speaker: Order, I apologise for interrupting,
but the hon. Gentleman must be heard.

377
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,110
>>Karl MᶜCartney: Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Finally, does my right hon. Friend share my

378
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,790
surprise that certain Opposition Front Benchers
have not learned that disagreeing with their

379
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,900
current party leader can cause headaches?

380
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:21,340
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right, and I think all of us and everybody

381
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,220
in the country wants to unite behind the Government’s
work to ensure that we get the best possible

382
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,430
deal for the United Kingdom as we leave the
European Union, and I believe that we can

383
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:36,510
get a deal that will be in the interests of
both the UK and the EU. I had hoped that I

384
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,250
would be able to welcome the shadow Home Secretary
to the Front Bench in time for the vote that

385
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,980
is going to take place later tonight. Perhaps
Labour Members are starting to realise that

386
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,350
their only real headache is their leader.

387
00:36:49,350 --> 00:37:00,650
>>Owen Smith (Pontypridd) (Lab): Does the
Prime Minister agree with the director general

388
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,800
of the World Trade Organisation that if Britain
were to leave the EU on WTO terms, it would

389
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,590
cost £9 billion in lost trade each year?

390
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,290
>>The Prime Minister: What we want to do is
to ensure that we negotiate a deal with the

391
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:23,860
European Union that enables us to have the
best possible deal in trading with and operating

392
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,890
within the European Union single market in
goods and services. I believe that is possible

393
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,630
precisely because, as I have just said in
response to my hon. Friend the Member for

394
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,040
Lincoln (Karl MᶜCartney), such a deal would
be good not just for us, but for the EU as

395
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,050
well.

396
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:46,110
>>Julian Sturdy (York Outer) (Con): The Prime
Minister rightly argues for true parity of

397
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,040
esteem between mental and physical health,
but parents in York have been told that their

398
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,620
children must wait up to a year for an assessment
by child and adolescent mental health services.

399
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,660
The Department of Health does not currently
record these figures, so will my right hon.

400
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,190
Friend consider making the monitoring of CAMHS
waiting times a requirement?

401
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,380
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important point. As I set out a few weeks

402
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,880
ago, the Government will be reviewing the
operation of CAMHS across the country, because

403
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,840
I recognise some of the concerns that hon.
Members have raised about it. We want to ensure

404
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,190
that children and young people have easy access
to mental health at the right time, because

405
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,210
of the evidence that a significant proportion
of mental health problems that arise later

406
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:38,080
in life actually start at the age of childhood
and adolescence. We have made more money available

407
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,280
to support transformation in children’s
and young people’s mental health, but the

408
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:55,491
shadow Health Secretary—sorry, I mean the
Health Secretary is on—[Interruption.] The

409
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:57,162
hon. Gentleman is in his place, as well. I
hope the shadow Health Secretary will agree

410
00:38:57,162 --> 00:39:02,840
with me that we need to review CAMHS and ensure
that we give the right to support to children,

411
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,770
young people and adolescents with mental health
problems. We will look at the issue that my

412
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,740
hon. Friend has raised.

413
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:15,210
>>Sue Hayman (Workington) (Lab): Many hon.
Members have recently made the long journey

414
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:20,160
up to west Cumbria for the Copeland by-election,
and will all have experienced the parlous

415
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,610
state of our roads and our local railways.
In fact, it has taken a by-election for Transport

416
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:31,930
Ministers to look seriously at, and show any
real interest in, the situation. Is the Prime

417
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,900
Minister planning a trip herself, so that
she, too, can experience why we need proper

418
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,340
investment from this Government into the transport
infrastructure in west Cumbria?

419
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:47,210
>>The Prime Minister: The Government are putting
more money into infrastructure throughout

420
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,500
the country. The Labour party had 13 years
in which to improve transport in west Cumbria,

421
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,210
and did not do anything about it.

422
00:39:54,210 --> 00:40:01,450
>>Chris Green (Bolton West) (Con): I recently
visited the headquarters of Woodall Nicholson,

423
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,150
a world-class coachbuilding company based
in my constituency, and heard about its exciting

424
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:13,120
plans for the future. Will my right hon. Friend
join me in emphasising the importance of skills

425
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,670
and manufacturing to our economy, especially
as we look to leave the European Union?

426
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:24,590
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for drawing our attention to the example of

427
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:30,910
Woodall Nicholson. We are pleased to hear
that it has those good plans for the future.

428
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,500
As we leave the EU, we will be doing so from
a position of strength, and my hon. Friend

429
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,040
is right to say that skills and manufacturing
are important parts of our economy for the

430
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,570
future. That is why, in the industrial strategy,
we are looking into how we can develop the

431
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,030
excellence that we have in the United Kingdom
to ensure that we have a prosperous, growing

432
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,350
economy for the future.

433
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:56,590
>>Ms Angela Eagle (Wallasey) (Lab): Last week,
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe

434
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:04,410
(Mr Clarke) pointed out that the Prime Minister’s
aspiration to achieve barrier-free, tariff-free

435
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:10,460
trade with the single market, getting all
the benefits but paying none of the costs,

436
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:17,220
was akin to disappearing down the rabbit hole
to Wonderland. I think that the Prime Minister

437
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:24,640
makes a very interesting choice for Alice,
but if she does not manage to achieve that

438
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,900
high ambition, will she produce an analysis
of what trading on the basis of WTO rules

439
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,800
would mean for our economy, so that we, too,
can make a proper choice?

440
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,970
>>The Prime Minister: I commend my right hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe

441
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:48,540
(Mr Clarke) for the significant service that
he has given to the House and his constituents

442
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,610
over the years. He and I have worked well
over a number of years—although I should

443
00:41:53,610 --> 00:42:01,030
add that, when I was Home Secretary, I used
to say, “I locked ’em up and he let ’em

444
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,030
out.”

445
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:11,060
The Government believe that it is possible,
within the two-year time frame, to secure

446
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,110
agreement not just on our withdrawal from
the European Union, but on the trade arrangements

447
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,380
that will ensure that we have a strong strategic
partnership with the European Union in the

448
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,380
future.

449
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:28,310
>>Sir Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar) (Con):
When my right hon. Friend met Mr Netanyahu

450
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:34,860
earlier this week, did she impress on him
that a lasting peace settlement can only be

451
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:41,300
secured if young Palestinians and young Israelis
can look forward to a job, a share in prosperity

452
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,040
and a life without fear? Does she agree that
that can only be achieved through face-to-face

453
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,840
negotiations, and will she join the Israeli
Prime Minister in pressing the Prime Minister

454
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,310
of the Palestinian National Authority to engage
in such negotiations?

455
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:02,970
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
has made an important point. We continue,

456
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:09,110
as a Conservative Government, to believe that
the two-state solution is the right one. It

457
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:16,350
means a viable Palestinian state, but also
a safe and secure Israel. Of course, it is

458
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:21,680
for the parties to negotiate: obviously, there
are others in the international arena who

459
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,940
are doing their work to facilitate an agreement
in the middle east, but ultimately it is for

460
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,700
the two parties to agree on a way forward.
