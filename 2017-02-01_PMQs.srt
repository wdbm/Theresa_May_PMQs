1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:11,560
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that the whole House will join me

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,320
in offering our condolences to the families
and friends of those who lost their lives

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,029
and were injured in the gun attack in Quebec
City on Sunday, and in paying tribute to our

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:29,699
former colleague Tam Dalyell, who died last
Friday. He was an outstanding parliamentarian,

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,870
and I am sure that all our thoughts are with
his friends and family.

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,570
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,890
in the House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,410
>>Peter Heaton-Jones (North Devon) (Con):
I associate myself with the remarks made by

9
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,570
the Prime Minister and the tribute paid to
the victims in Canada and to the family of

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,680
Tam Dalyell.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,140
North Devon is quite rightly concerned that
the current review of health services across

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,750
the county may result in the loss of some
acute services at our hospital in Barnstaple.

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,509
For some residents, the nearest alternative
could be three hours away. Will my right hon.

14
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,880
Friend assure me that she will listen carefully
to those concerns, because I want to be able

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,890
to say to North Devon that we are the party
of the NHS?

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:33,869
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for his question. I can reassure him that

17
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,090
this Government are absolutely committed to
ensuring the best possible healthcare for

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,780
patients right across the country. I recognise
that concerns have been expressed locally

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,020
about the North Devon district hospital. I
understand that there are no specific proposals

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,290
at the moment, but I know that the input of
local communities will remain crucial throughout

21
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,020
the process, and I can assure him that of
course it is this party in government that

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,939
is putting the extra funding into the NHS
and showing how we value it.

23
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,440
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): I
join the Prime Minister in offering condolences

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,720
to all those who died in the horrific attack,
fuelled by hate, in Quebec, and we should

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,210
send our solidarity to everyone in Canada
on this sad occasion.

26
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,250
May I also associate myself with the Prime
Minister’s tribute to the former Member

27
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,820
for West Lothian, and later Linlithgow, Tam
Dalyell? A Labour MP and former Father of

28
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,140
the House, he doggedly fought to expose official
wrongdoing and cover-ups, from the miners

29
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,630
strike to Iraq. I am sure the Prime Minister
would agree that Tam’s scrutiny and contributions

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,570
made this House a better place, and may I
recommend to all Members his autobiography

31
00:02:47,570 --> 00:03:04,870
“The Importance of Being Awkward”? [Interruption.]
And I am quite happy to offer my copy to the

32
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,870
Secretary of State for Brexit to have a good
read of it. I am sure that he has probably

33
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,800
already read it.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,780
At last week’s Prime Minister Question Time,
the Prime Minister told the House:

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,460
“I am not afraid to speak frankly to a President
of the United States”. What happened?

36
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:34,150
>>The Prime Minister: First, let me say that
I was not aware of Tam Dalyell’s book “The

37
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,210
Importance of Being Awkward”, but given
the number of resignations that the right

38
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,150
hon. Gentleman has had from his Front Bench,
I suspect that some of his colleagues have

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:49,970
indeed read it.

40
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,700
I am pleased to say to the right hon. Gentleman
that when I visited the United States, I was

41
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:03,180
able to build on the relationship that we
have with our most important ally and get

42
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:11,240
some very significant commitments from President
Trump. Crucial among those was a 100% commitment

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,640
to NATO—NATO which keeps us safe and keeps
Europe safe too.

44
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,340
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Downing Street has not denied
that the Prime Minister was told by the White

45
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,479
House that the Executive order on travel to
the US was imminent, so let us be clear: was

46
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,789
the Prime Minister told about the ban during
her visit, and did she try to persuade President

47
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,219
Trump otherwise?

48
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:45,289
>>The Prime Minister: On the policy that President
Trump has introduced, this Government are

49
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:54,539
clear that it is wrong. We would not do it.
In six years as Home Secretary, I never introduced

50
00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:00,480
such a policy. We believe it is divisive and
wrong. If the right hon. Gentleman is asking

51
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,740
me whether I had advance notice of the ban
on refugees, the answer is no. If he is asking

52
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,520
me if I had advance notice that the Executive
order could affect British citizens, the answer

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,800
is no. If he is asking if I had advance notice
of the travel restrictions, the answer is,

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,249
we all did, because President Trump said in
his election campaign that he was going to

55
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:38,789
do this. The question is how you respond.
The job of Government is not to chase the

56
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:49,289
headlines; the job of Government is not to
take to the streets in protest; the job of

57
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,189
Government is to protect the interests of
British citizens, and that is exactly what

58
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,860
we did.

59
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,979
>>Jeremy Corbyn: On the day after the Executive
order was made to ban refugees and visitors

60
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,809
from seven predominantly Muslim countries,
why did the Prime Minister three times refuse

61
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,289
to condemn the ban?

62
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:16,400
>>The Prime Minister: I have made it very
clear that we believe that this policy is

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,060
divisive and wrong, and that it is not a policy
that we would introduce. I have also made

64
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,960
it very clear when asked about this that this
Government have a very different approach

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,580
to these issues. On refugees, this Government
have a proud record of the support that we

66
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,820
have given to them, and long may it continue.

67
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,110
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Prime Minister said:
“The United States is responsible for the

68
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,229
United States’ policy on refugees.”

69
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:50,979
But surely it is the responsibility of all
of us to defend the 1951 refugee convention,

70
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:58,199
which commits this country, the United States
and 142 other states to accept refugees without

71
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,620
regard to their

72
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,120
“race, religion or country of origin.”

73
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,270
President Trump has breached that convention.
Why did she not speak out?

74
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,409
>>The Prime Minister: First, I have made absolutely
clear what the Government’s view on this

75
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:19,000
policy is. Secondly, as I have just said,
this Government and this country have a proud

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,889
record on how we welcome refugees. In recent
years, we have introduced a very particular

77
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,560
scheme to ensure that particularly vulnerable
refugees in Syria can be brought to this country,

78
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,749
and something like 10,000 Syrian refugees
have come to this country since the conflict

79
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:44,650
began. We are also the second biggest bilateral
donor, helping and supporting refugees in

80
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,169
the region. That is what we are doing. I have
said that the US policy is wrong. We will

81
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,839
take a different view, and we will continue
to welcome refugees to this country.

82
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,740
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I also wrote to the Prime
Minister on this issue and received her reply

83
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:06,969
this morning. I hold in my hand her piece
of paper. She makes no mention of the refugee

84
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:13,539
convention and does not condemn US action
in that respect.

85
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:22,169
Last week, I asked the Prime Minister to assure
the House that she would not offer up our

86
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,729
national health service as a “bargaining
chip” in any US trade deal. She gave no

87
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:34,279
answer. She also refused to rule it out when
asked in the US, so let me ask her a third

88
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,130
time: will she rule out opening up our national
health service to private US healthcare companies—yes

89
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,570
or no?

90
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:50,420
>>The Prime Minister: I could give a detailed
answer to the right hon. Gentleman’s question,

91
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,310
but a simple and straightforward reply is
what is required: the NHS is not for sale

92
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,790
and it never will be.

93
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:14,160
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I hope that that includes
not having US healthcare companies coming

94
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,660
in to run any part of our national health
service.

95
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,949
President Trump has torn up international
agreements on refugees. He has threatened

96
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:33,690
to dump international agreements on climate
change. He has praised the use of torture.

97
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,851
He has incited hatred against Muslims. He
has directly attacked women’s rights. Just

98
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:47,980
what more does he have to do before the Prime
Minister will listen to the 1.8 million people

99
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,800
who have already called for his state visit
invitation to be withdrawn?

100
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:02,380
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman’s
foreign policy is to object to and insult

101
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:10,209
the democratically elected Head of State of
our most important ally. Let us see what he

102
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,370
would have achieved in the last week. Would
he have been able to protect British citizens

103
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,430
from the impact of the Executive order? No.
Would he have been able to lay the foundations

104
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:28,750
of a trade deal? No. Would he have got a 100%
commitment to NATO? No. That is what Labour

105
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:37,759
has to offer this country—less protection
for British citizens, less prosperity, less

106
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:47,080
safety. He can lead a protest; I am leading
a country.

107
00:10:47,080 --> 00:11:07,519
>>Stuart Andrew (Pudsey) (Con): Today it is
inconceivable that somebody would be prosecuted

108
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,540
based on who and what they are. Will my right
hon. Friend join me in welcoming the posthumous

109
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,389
pardon of some 49,000 men thanks to the Government’s
Turing Bill which was enacted yesterday? Will

110
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,230
she also encourage those who are still alive
to come forward so that their injustices can

111
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
be overturned?

112
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,889
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to join
my hon. Friend in welcoming an extremely important

113
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,569
change in the law. We committed to it in our
manifesto and have now delivered on it. Passing

114
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:44,259
Turing’s law has been a long-standing commitment
for the Government. It is momentous and takes

115
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:48,720
action to right the wrongs of the past. Like
my hon. Friend, I certainly encourage those

116
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,610
still alive to apply to the Home Office to
have their offences disregarded.

117
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,880
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): We on the
SNP Benches associate ourselves with all the

118
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,740
comments thus far about the tragic deaths
in Quebec City and about the passing of Tam

119
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,560
Dalyell. Respect for him was held across the
political parties and he served with great

120
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
distinction for more than 40 years.

121
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:20,910
The Prime Minister had a successful international
visit this last week—to Ireland. She spoke

122
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:29,110
publicly about her commitment—this is important—not
to have a hard border on these islands, to

123
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,050
the continuation of free movement of peoples
on these islands and to protect and enhance

124
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,860
trade. Given that people will be watching
this not just in Britain but in Ireland, will

125
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,580
she take this opportunity to explain how she
will deliver those sensible, important outcomes?

126
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,399
>>The Prime Minister: Those are absolutely
the outcomes that we want to see. I was very

127
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,649
pleased to meet the Taoiseach and to discuss
with him the joint intent that both his Government

128
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,240
and mine have to ensure that we do not see
a return to the borders of the past in Northern

129
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,660
Ireland. We focus on the land border that
is between Northern Ireland and the Republic

130
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,100
of Ireland. Of course, the issue of movements
from Ireland affects other places as well;

131
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,889
it affects ports in Wales and Stranraer. Therefore,
it is an important issue for us and we have

132
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:29,639
agreed the work that we are going to do together
to deliver what I believe will be as frictionless

133
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,089
a border as possible. Also, one of the objectives
that I set out in my plan for our negotiating

134
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,340
objectives is to retain the common travel
area.

135
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,879
>>Angus Robertson: We on the SNP Benches very
much welcome what the Prime Minister has just

136
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,560
said on all those issues. Of course, we also
welcome the intensifying of negotiations between

137
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,560
the UK Government and the devolved Administrations
ahead of triggering article 50. The Prime

138
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,389
Minister has very helpfully explained that
it is perfectly possible for parts of these

139
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,680
islands to be in the single market, without
hard borders, with free movement of people,

140
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,139
while at the same time protecting and enhancing
trade with one another. That is very, very

141
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:18,371
welcome, so will she give a commitment to
work with the Irish Government and a commitment

142
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:23,939
to work with the Scottish Government to deliver
all those things—or will we just have to

143
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,560
get on with it ourselves?

144
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,700
>>The Prime Minister: First, the right hon.
Gentleman is right that following the meeting

145
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,100
of the Joint Ministerial Committee plenary
on Monday morning, we agreed to intensify

146
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,279
discussion on issues related to the bringing
back of powers from Brussels and where those

147
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,069
powers should lie within the UK—to intensify
that in the run-up to the triggering of article

148
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:53,699
50 and beyond the triggering of article 50.

149
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,029
On the other question, the right hon. Gentleman
really should listen to the answers that are

150
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,040
given, because he is trying to imply something
that is not there. [Hon. Members: “Oh!”]

151
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:09,060
Yes. We are very clear that we want to see
a frictionless border between Northern Ireland

152
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,790
and the Republic of Ireland, but I am also
clear that one of the objectives of our negotiation

153
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,420
is to see as frictionless a border as possible
between the UK and the rest of the European

154
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,629
Union. Of course, if he is so worried about
having a frictionless border between Scotland

155
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:29,569
and countries in the EU, he should not want
to take Scotland out of the EU by wanting

156
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:34,399
to see it independent. [Interruption.]

157
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,709
>>Mr Speaker: Order. We should not have to
allow for the reaction from the SNP Benches

158
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,930
to every answer before we proceed to the next
question.

159
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:51,499
>>Mrs Maria Miller (Basingstoke) (Con): EU
nationals provide a vital and expert service

160
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:57,199
in my local hospital in Basingstoke and, along
with thousands of others, they face an uncertain

161
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,920
future. I know that this is something that
the Prime Minister wants to give priority

162
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,000
to and to sort out. Will we be hearing more
about it in the forthcoming White Paper?

163
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,810
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
makes an important point about EU nationals.

164
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,800
I would like to confirm my intention and expectation
that we will be able to offer that reassurance

165
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,629
to EU nationals living in the UK, but I also
want to see reassurance offered to UK nationals

166
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,110
living in the EU. I hope and will be working
to try to ensure that this is an issue we

167
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,519
can deal with at a very early stage in the
negotiations. It was one of the objectives

168
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,879
I set out in the plan. It will be referenced
in the White Paper and I can inform my right

169
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,310
hon. Friend and the House that that White
Paper will be published tomorrow.

170
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:47,009
>>Jonathan Reynolds (Stalybridge and Hyde)
(Lab/Co-op): Prime Minister, your responses

171
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:59,649
today have been deeply unsatisfactory. The
President of the United States has advocated

172
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,890
torture, misogyny, racial discrimination,
sexual assault and isolationism. The leaders

173
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,529
of Canada and Germany were able to respond
robustly, but your response was to jump on

174
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:18,309
a plane as soon as possible to hold his hand.
Does this country not deserve a leader who

175
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,260
is willing to stand up for British values?

176
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:27,740
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I have issued no response
and the hon. Gentleman not only should not

177
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,050
breach parliamentary protocol but should not
tempt me.

178
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:38,091
>>The Prime Minister: I will tell you what
standing up for British values is. I and this

179
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:44,720
Government introduced the first Modern Slavery
Act in this country. I have ensured that stop

180
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
and search has reduced, because I do not believe
that anyone on the streets of this country

181
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,110
should be stopped and searched because of
the colour of their skin, and I ensured justice

182
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,460
for the families of Hillsborough.

183
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,679
>>Mrs Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con):
In light of the fact that most of the countries

184
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,031
covered by the Trump ban have a total bar
on the admission of Israeli citizens, should

185
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,299
the protestors not be calling for that ban
to be lifted as well?

186
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:17,570
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my right hon.
Friend for pointing that out. It is absolutely

187
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:24,160
right that the House should be aware of the
discrimination around the world and of that

188
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,809
ban, particularly for those who are Israeli
citizens. We are consistent: we do not agree

189
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:34,130
with that approach and it is not one that
we will take. I wait for the day when the

190
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,570
right hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy
Corbyn) stands up and condemns it too.

191
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,090
>>Chris Elmore (Ogmore) (Lab/Co-op): My constituent
Dianah Kendall suffered a bleed on the brain

192
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:50,060
in 2012 and has struggled to work since, but
was due to retire in September. Government

193
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,730
changes to her state pension retirement age
mean that she will now not retire until 2022.

194
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:02,840
This injustice has short-changed 2.6 million
WASPI women and brings shame on this Government.

195
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,520
Will the Prime Minister think again and support
Dianah and the millions of women who deserve

196
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,610
fairness in retirement?

197
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:18,370
>>The Prime Minister: On the issue of those
who are known as the WASPI campaign, I refer

198
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,360
the hon. Gentleman to the fact that, as I
am sure he knows, we committed more than £1

199
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,429
billion to lessen the impact on those worst
affected, so no one will see their pension

200
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:33,679
age change by more than 18 months. There is
a wider point: we need to be realistic when

201
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,820
considering pension ages about the fact that
people are living longer. If we want to carry

202
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,910
on having an affordable and sustainable pension
system, we need to equalise the state pension

203
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,880
age for men and women faster and to bring
forward the rise.

204
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,750
>>Will Quince (Colchester) (Con): I welcome
the £450 million announced in the autumn

205
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:58,640
statement to fund a trial of the digital railway.
Given the new fleet of trains on order and

206
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,970
the economic growth opportunity for our region,
does the Prime Minister agree that the great

207
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,110
eastern main line has the most compelling
case for that pilot?

208
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,240
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right about the importance of transport links

209
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,669
for economic growth. I understand that digital
signalling could increase capacity on commuter

210
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:27,039
trains by up to 40%, hence the investment
of £450 million for trials over the coming

211
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,730
years to which he rightly refers. I know that
the Department for Transport is considering

212
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,029
where those trials should take place, but
we certainly recognise that the great eastern

213
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,980
main line is one area that could benefit from
those improvements.

214
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,650
>>John Nicolson (East Dunbartonshire) (SNP):
A few moments ago, the Prime Minister tried

215
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,480
to claim credit for passing Stonewall’s
Turing Bill. She did not; the Turing Bill

216
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,770
pardons all gay men found guilty of crimes
no longer on the statute book. When will the

217
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,650
Prime Minister follow the Scottish Government
and automatically pardon the living as well

218
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,870
as the dead?

219
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,220
>>The Prime Minister: It was during my time
as Home Secretary that the legislation was

220
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,710
introduced that gives those who are alive
the opportunity to apply to the Home Office

221
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,370
to have those offences that are no longer
on the statute book expunged from their record—

222
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,514
>>John Nicolson: They are not doing it.

223
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:19,550
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman says
that they are not doing it. In this Chamber

224
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:24,809
today my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey
(Stuart Andrew) and I have both encouraged

225
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:29,820
people to come forward and make that application,
and that is a message that we should all put

226
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,820
out.

227
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,640
>>James Duddridge (Rochford and Southend East)
(Con): At the White House, my right hon. Friend

228
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,820
gained some assurances from President Trump
about his commitment to NATO, an achievement

229
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,241
that was welcomed by the Governments of the
Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania. Does

230
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:50,580
my right hon. Friend agree that the way to
engage with President Trump and to win such

231
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:58,190
agreements is not by insulting our close ally
but by bringing him close, rather than doing

232
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,950
as the Leader of the Opposition demands? If
we reject our closest ally, would that not

233
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,800
leave Britain and our European partners less
safe and less secure?

234
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,840
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right. We should never forget that America

235
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,120
is our most important ally. Our relationship
is long standing and American men and women

236
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,790
served and died alongside UK men and women
in two world wars to protect our security

237
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:33,210
and the security of Europe. If we were not
able to have that relationship and to see

238
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,420
that commitment to NATO, in particular, we
would leave this country and Europe less safe.

239
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,690
>>Deidre Brock (Edinburgh North and Leith)
(SNP): Many were surprised that immediately

240
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,059
after those cosy images with Donald Trump
were taken the Prime Minister chose to meet

241
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,340
the Turkish President, who has been running
an increasingly repressive regime since the

242
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,390
failed coup last summer. Will she confirm
whether she raised any human rights concerns

243
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,710
with President Erdoğan, or, as we turn our
face from Europe, will it be the policy of

244
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,490
post-Brexit Britain to put arms deals before
human rights abuses?

245
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,309
>>The Prime Minister: First, the hon. Lady
should recognise that Turkey is an important

246
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:19,130
country in relation both to our security and
the issue of migration into Turkey and potentially

247
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:26,950
into Europe. She will also recognise that
Turkey has, and continues to host, 3 million

248
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,510
refugees from Syria, and I commended the Turkish
Government on the welcome they have given

249
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,840
them. I suggest that she should just have
looked at the press conference I gave after

250
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,320
my discussions with President Erdoğan and
Prime Minister Yildirim, in which I made it

251
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,780
clear that we had condemned the coup but expected
the Turkish Government to support their democratic

252
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,360
institutions, international human rights and
the rule of law.

253
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,550
>>Alec Shelbrooke (Elmet and Rothwell) (Con):
I wholeheartedly congratulate my right hon.

254
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,210
Friend on securing 100% for NATO from the
new US Administration. Will she outline what

255
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,779
she is doing to persuade our other NATO allies
of the importance of achieving what was agreed

256
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,320
at the NATO Wales summit on their obligations?

257
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,850
>>The Prime Minister: First, I thank my hon.
Friend for the work that he does on the NATO

258
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,559
Parliamentary Assembly. I know he is fully
engaged with that. He is right that commitments

259
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,700
were made at the NATO summit in Wales in 2014,
when all our NATO allies committed to spending

260
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,280
2% of their GDP on defence within a decade.
We have seen progress, but I agree with President

261
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,150
Trump that many allies need to go further.
I can assure my hon. Friend that I and other

262
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,539
Ministers across Government raise the issue
regularly with our allies and partners and

263
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:50,750
will continue to do so.

264
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:57,910
>>Ruth Cadbury (Brentford and Isleworth) (Lab):
Last week, air pollution in London was worse

265
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,650
than in Beijing. Will the Prime Minister therefore
assure me and my constituents in Osterley,

266
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,830
Brentford and Chiswick that the hugely expensive
proposal to double the capacity of the M4

267
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,100
as it arrives in London will be shelved forthwith?

268
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,380
>>The Prime Minister: I can assure the hon.
Lady that this Government take the issue of

269
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:29,789
air quality very seriously. A lot of work
has been done. Since 2011 more than £2 billion

270
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:34,679
has been committed to enable, for example,
bus operators to upgrade their fleets, and

271
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,769
to ensure that changes are made to reduce
pollution from vehicles such as refuse trucks

272
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:44,040
and fire engines. We do recognise, however,
that more needs to be done. We have seen a

273
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,210
reduction in nitrous oxide from some 17% in
recent years, but we will bring forward proposals

274
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,549
to ensure that we can maintain the air quality
that we all want to see.

275
00:25:53,549 --> 00:26:02,030
>>Richard Benyon (Newbury) (Con): Will my
right hon. Friend show her support for “Brighter

276
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,480
Berkshire”, the campaign as part of the
2017 year of mental health? Will she give

277
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,500
her continued commitment to ensuring that
we have parity between mental health and physical

278
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
health in this country?

279
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,799
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to endorse
the campaign to which my hon. Friend refers.

280
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,700
It is important that we continue to raise
awareness of the issues around mental health.

281
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,160
The fact the Government have committed to
the parity of esteem between mental and physical

282
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,960
health is important. There is more for us
to do on mental health, and I have already

283
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,210
set out some steps that we want to take. I
commend all those, however, who are working

284
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,840
to raise the issue of mental health and provide
support to those with mental health problems.

285
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:51,350
>>Mr Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow) (Lab): The Association
of Directors of Adult Social Services has

286
00:26:51,350 --> 00:27:00,179
said that £4.6 billion has been cut from
social care budgets since 2010. Does the Prime

287
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:08,710
Minister take any responsibility for the pain
and the distress that the Tories have inflicted

288
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:15,620
on poor, vulnerable old people being denied
their rightful care? Yes or no?

289
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,649
>>The Prime Minister: The Government have
taken a number of steps to increase the funding

290
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:26,470
available for local authorities to provide
for social care. It is also important that

291
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,490
we ensure that best practice is developed
and put into place across the country. In

292
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,110
some parts of the country the record on social
care and the interaction with hospitals is

293
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:43,990
better than in others, but the longer-term
issue is for us to ensure that we have a sustainable

294
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,299
system for delivering social care for people
in this country. The Labour party ducked that

295
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,570
issue for 13 years. We are addressing it.

296
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:59,769
>>Andrea Jenkyns (Morley and Outwood) (Con):
Will my right hon. Friend join me in congratulating

297
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:06,299
Morley Academy on its recently awarded World
Class Schools quality mark and say how such

298
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,559
awards drive pupil excellence?

299
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,000
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to join my
hon. Friend in congratulating the whole team

300
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,779
at Morley Academy on receiving the award,
which I think shows the work that the GORSE

301
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,740
Academies Trust is doing to drive up excellence
and improve outcomes for pupils. We are determined

302
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,700
to drive up standards in schools to ensure
that more children have good school places—a

303
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,890
good school place for every child—so that
they can all reach the sort of level we see

304
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,890
at Morley Academy.

305
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,409
>>Mr David Winnick (Walsall North) (Lab):
How will the thousands of people who lost

306
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:44,039
their jobs at British Home Stores feel about
the fact that it may take years before the

307
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:52,800
case of Philip Green, the totally discredited
and disgraced businessperson, results in his

308
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:59,610
knighthood being taken away or otherwise?
Is it not remarkable? People lose their jobs

309
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:05,130
and suffer all the consequences, but this
man keeps his billions and his knighthood.

310
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:12,690
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
an important issue. Many Members of this House

311
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:19,480
have expressed concern about what happened
at BHS and the attitude and approach taken

312
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,279
by Philip Green. Whether a knighthood should
be taken away from someone is a matter for

313
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,169
the relevant committee—I have forgotten
the name—which will be examining the case;

314
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:36,590
I understand that it is waiting for the investigations
to be completed. This is a matter for an independent

315
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,750
committee and it is up to the committee how
it looks into it.

316
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,210
>>Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con): Tonight,
there will be an historic vote in this place,

317
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,720
a vote that I thought I would not see in my
political lifetime: the British Parliament

318
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,039
voting to withdraw from the European Union
under the excellent leadership of the Prime

319
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:06,029
Minister. Is my right hon. Friend surprised
that Opposition Members who demand time to

320
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:11,610
discuss the matter and debate it—namely,
the Liberal Democrats—did not even bother

321
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,090
to turn up last night? The Government Benches
were packed, the Scottish National party Benches

322
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,409
were packed, the Democratic Unionist party
Members were here, and there were some Labour

323
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:28,409
Members. Is that not surprising?

324
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:37,220
>>The Prime Minister: Throughout my political
career I have fought Liberal Democrats, and

325
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:47,519
nothing that they do ever surprises me, but
I join my hon. Friend in commending the Bill

326
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,000
before the House. This House has a very simple
decision to take. We gave the right of judgment

327
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,630
on this matter to the British people, and
they made their choice: they want to leave

328
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,450
the EU. The question every Member must ask
themselves as they go through the Lobby tonight

329
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,789
is: do they trust the people?

330
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:13,350
>>Mr Speaker: Well, the right hon. Gentleman
is here now, so let us hear the fellow—Tim

331
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,350
Farron.

332
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,769
>>Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

333
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:22,159
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
Who would have guessed it, Mr Speaker? We

334
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:35,700
are here now, asking the questions—[Interruption]—asking
the 

335
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,179
questions about the future of our country
and Brexit that a strong Leader of the Opposition

336
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,000
should be asking—

337
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,149
>>Hon. Members: Where were you?

338
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:51,470
>>Mr Speaker: Order. [Interruption.] Mr Knight,
I am very worried about you. You recently

339
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,010
suffered from a bad leg. With all that shouting,
you will be suffering from a bad head. Calm

340
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,840
yourself man!

341
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:10,470
>>Tim Farron: The Prime Minister will return
at some point with a deal with Europe that

342
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:17,179
our people will have to live with for decades
to come, especially our young people, 73%

343
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:26,030
of whom voted to remain. Nobody knows what
that deal will look like, but someone will

344
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,040
get to agree it. Should it be her Government,
should it be this Parliament, or should it

345
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,580
be—as I believe it should—the British
people?

346
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,659
>>The Prime Minister: I have already said
that there will be a vote on the deal in this

347
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,799
Parliament. [Interruption.]

348
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,360
>>Mr Speaker: Mr Shelbrooke, calm yourself.
You are in a state of excessive excitement,

349
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,149
even by your standards.

350
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:58,480
>>Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) (Con): It
is quite difficult to follow that, Mr Speaker,

351
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,320
but back in the real world—[Laughter.]

352
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,130
In December 2015, my constituency suffered
terrible flooding, especially in the town

353
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:18,220
of Tadcaster. The damage became worse when
the bridge collapsed, separating the town.

354
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:24,899
Thankfully, the bridge will be reopened, hopefully
this week. Will the Prime Minister join me

355
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:31,710
in thanking all those who were involved in
the restoration of the bridge and, most importantly,

356
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,630
the residents of Tadcaster, who have had a
terrible year?

357
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:41,149
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to join my
hon. Friend in commending and thanking not

358
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:47,220
only all those who worked so hard to restore
the bridge at Tadcaster, but the people of

359
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,730
Tadcaster, who have had to put up with disruption
and inconvenience for such a long time. I

360
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,679
am sure that those people will all welcome
the return of the bridge, and we commend all

361
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,130
those who have ensured that that has happened.

362
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,820
>>John Woodcock (Barrow and Furness) (Lab/Co-op):
The news revealed yesterday that Toshiba is

363
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:14,040
reviewing its investment in the Moorside nuclear
power plant, which puts a huge question mark

364
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,000
over not only 21,000 jobs in Cumbria but the
future of our nation’s energy security.

365
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,409
What will the Prime Minister do personally
to ensure that the deal stays on track?

366
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,510
>>The Prime Minister: I assure the hon. Gentleman
that both the Business Secretary and I have

367
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:37,030
involvement in a number of deals and possible
deals around the nuclear industry. We are

368
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,470
keen to ensure that those jobs are brought
to the United Kingdom and that such deals

369
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:47,319
are kept on track. I assure him of the Government’s
commitment.

370
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:56,629
>>Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) (Con): This
week the Danish drug firm Novo Nordisk invested

371
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:03,900
£115 million in the UK to further research
into type 2 diabetes. Will the Prime Minister

372
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,901
join me in welcoming that investment as well
as the academics and scientists involved,

373
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:12,290
many of whom are from the EU and around the
world and will appreciate the assurance she

374
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,210
gave earlier? Will she also work with me to
ensure that any innovations and new treatments

375
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,980
get to patients as quickly as possible?

376
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,200
>>The Prime Minister: As my hon. Friend will
probably understand, I recognise this issue

377
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,950
particularly personally, although I am a type
1 diabetic rather than type 2. Any investment

378
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:40,050
in diabetes research is to be welcomed, and
when new solutions and support for diabetics

379
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,201
are found, it is important that they get to
people as quickly as possible. A significant

380
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:49,550
number of people in this country suffer from
type 2 diabetes, and the figures show that

381
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,069
there is a great risk that the number will
increase significantly in the coming years.

382
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,810
We need to do all that we can not only to
prevent people from becoming type 2 diabetics

383
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:05,050
in the first place, but to support those who
have that condition so that people suffer

384
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,320
from fewer complications and are able to manage
their lives.

385
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,660
>>Ms Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh (Ochil and South
Perthshire) (SNP): Today is World Hijab Day.

386
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,839
Will the Prime Minister join me in recognising
the right of Muslim women to wear the hijab

387
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,170
if they wish, without fear, and indeed the
right of all women everywhere to wear what

388
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:30,650
they want, when they want? Will she also commit
to standing up for the right to refuge for

389
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,190
men, women and children wherever they may
be, regardless of their religion?

390
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:41,740
>>The Prime Minister: On the hon. Lady’s
second point, it is absolutely the case that

391
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,270
this country welcomes refuges to the United
Kingdom, and we do so regardless of their

392
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,880
religion—there is no question of discriminating
on religion.

393
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,250
I am absolutely in line with the hon. Lady
on her point about wearing the hijab. I believe

394
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,119
that what a woman wears is a woman’s choice.

395
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,170
>>Sir Julian Brazier (Canterbury) (Con): Russian
armed forces regularly carry out large-scale

396
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:12,540
exercises, including with nuclear-capable
equipment, on the borders of eastern Europe.

397
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:21,910
Does my right hon. Friend agree that the American
commitment to NATO is absolutely pivotal to

398
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:27,619
protect the countries of eastern Europe from
going the same way as eastern Ukraine?

399
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:33,890
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely agree with
my hon. Friend. The 100% commitment to NATO

400
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:41,070
that President Trump has given is crucial
to ensuring that we can provide for the security

401
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,490
of this country and others in Europe, especially
those in eastern Europe on the border with

402
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,470
Russia. I noted that my hon. Friend the Member
for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge)

403
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,250
referred to the fact that the Governments
of the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania

404
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:02,670
had welcomed that 100% commitment. I am pleased
to say that we are playing our part, as about

405
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,510
800 troops will be going to Poland and Estonia
this year as a sign of NATO’s strength and

406
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,040
our belief in keeping those countries free
and democratic.

407
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,000
>>Naz Shah (Bradford West) (Lab): In 2015,
my constituent Samia Shahid was lured to her

408
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,940
death in Pakistan, where she was brutally
raped and murdered. Will the Prime Minister

409
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,220
join me in reiterating the commitment of this
House and this country that we will not tolerate

410
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,290
violence against women, and encourage the
Pakistani Government to continue in their

411
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,329
efforts to get justice for our British girl,
Samia Shahid?

412
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:48,660
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady raises
a very tragic case, and our deepest sympathies

413
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,290
are with Samia’s husband following her tragic
death last year. We do not interfere in the

414
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,361
legal processes of another country, but I
understand from the Foreign Office that the

415
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:03,890
Pakistani police have arrested two people
and charged them with murder. The Foreign

416
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,440
Office has provided assistance to Samia’s
husband and will continue to do so. I am sure

417
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,990
it will keep the hon. Lady informed, and I
understand that the Home Secretary will meet

418
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,690
the hon. Lady soon to discuss this issue.
