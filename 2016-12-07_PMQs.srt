1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:17,029
>>The Leader of the House of Commons (Mr David
Lidington): I have been asked to reply. My

2
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,960
right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is visiting
the Gulf Co-operation Council summit in Bahrain.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,210
in the House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,820
>>Dr Philippa Whitford (Central Ayrshire)
(SNP): Yesterday’s signing of a memorandum

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,899
of understanding with Houston spaceport and
the Rice Space Institute brings the reality

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,550
of a Prestwick spaceport closer, with the
huge boost that that could give to the UK

8
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,239
aerospace industry. Will the UK Government
join the Scottish Government in supporting

9
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,859
an Ayrshire growth deal to literally get this
off the ground?

10
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:01,579
>>Mr Lidington: I can certainly assure the
hon. Lady that the Government are looking

11
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,710
keenly at the opportunities for Scotland,
and indeed the whole United Kingdom, arising

12
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,250
from the possible future development of commercial
space operations. The Ayrshire project that

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,850
she has described will, I am sure, be examined
closely by my ministerial colleagues who are

14
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,190
particularly concerned about this area of
policy. We definitely want to see the UK as

15
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,950
a pioneer in seizing these new commercial
opportunities.

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,640
>>Sir Peter Bottomley (Worthing West) (Con):
Perhaps thinking of rail passengers trying

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,220
to get to their jobs, the general secretary
of the TUC has spoken about “shafted and

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,210
abandoned” workers, while Unite’s Len
McCluskey is doing a UKIP dance move by resigning

19
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,080
before trying to return. Will my right hon.
Friend encourage union and other political

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,790
leaders to tell the National Union of Rail,
Maritime and Transport Workers that 250 people

21
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,560
with guaranteed employment should not be putting
the lives, jobs and safety of 600,000 Southern

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,550
rail passengers at risk?

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:04,289
>>Mr Lidington: I am sure that my hon. Friend
speaks on behalf of thousands of rail passengers

24
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:09,550
in his constituency and many others in the
south of England. It is deeply disappointing

25
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,130
that some unions are threatening to strike
over the Christmas period. The Government

26
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,080
are now investing record amounts in improving
our railways—up to £40 billion over the

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,550
next five years—and we need everyone in
industry, both management and unions, to work

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,480
together to secure the best deal for passengers.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,330
I have to say that the RMT’s action shows
co-ordinated contempt for the travelling public,

30
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,681
and it seems designed to do nothing except
to bring about the maximum damage to people’s

31
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:46,160
lives—[Interruption.] There is some heckling
from Opposition Members. The Conservative

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:56,910
party is on the side of rail passengers, and
I hope that the Labour party will join me

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,170
in saying to the rail union leaders, “Sort
it out, put the travelling public first, stop

34
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:10,300
the squabbling, and tell your members to get
back to work.”

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,770
>>Emily Thornberry (Islington South and Finsbury)
(Lab): I am sure that the whole House will

36
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,600
want to join me in commemorating the 75th
anniversary of the Pearl Harbour attack, in

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,800
which thousands of American service personnel
and civilians died. The next day, Winston

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,690
Churchill summoned Parliament to debate the
British response and said:

39
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,810
“It is indispensable to our system of government
that Parliament should play its full part

40
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,010
in all the important acts of State”.—[Official
Report, 8 December 1941; Vol. 376, c. 1358.]

41
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,040
These words are a vital reminder that even
at a time of crisis—in fact, especially

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,090
at a time of national crisis—the role of
Parliament is central.

43
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,951
In the same spirit, we welcome the Government’s
decision to accept our motion today; they

44
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:04,651
will show Parliament their plan for Brexit
before article 50 is triggered. May I ask

45
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:10,710
the Leader of the House one central question
about this plan: do the Government want the

46
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,400
UK to remain part of the customs union?

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:28,590
>>Mr Lidington: I join the hon. Lady in marking
the anniversary of Pearl Harbour and remembering

48
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:37,260
all those who lost their lives at that time,
and also in marking—with a sense of some

49
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:45,450
celebration, even—the fact that Prime Minister
Abe is joining President Obama in going to

50
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,480
Pearl Harbour. He is the first Japanese Prime
Minister so to do, and that sign of reconciliation

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,000
and putting ancient conflicts behind them
is welcome.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,960
To turn to the hon. Lady’s point about Europe,
the Government have always made it clear that

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,410
we would seek to give additional clarity about
our position at the earliest opportunity,

54
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,010
but it has been the case, as my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister has said many times,

55
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,580
that one of our core objectives will be to
secure the maximum freedom for British companies

56
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,000
both to have access to and to operate within
the single European market.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,940
>>Emily Thornberry: I thank the Leader of
the House for that answer, but I respectfully

58
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,050
say to him that surely on this issue the answer
should be straightforward. We all know that

59
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,190
it would be a disaster for British business
if we did not remain part of the customs union.

60
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,170
The Leader of the House said himself in February:

61
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:48,860
“Everything we take for granted…—trade…without
customs checks or paperwork at national frontiers…—would

62
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,330
all be up in the air... It is massive what
is at risk.”

63
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,330
On this side of the House, we would agree
with him—we could not agree with him more—so

64
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,889
can he put it beyond doubt and tell us right
now: do the Government want the UK to stay

65
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,060
in the customs union?

66
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:15,800
>>Mr Lidington: The hon. Lady and I—she
is right—both argued passionately for the

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,320
remain cause during the referendum. What separates
us now is that I am part of a Conservative

68
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Government who are working together to respect
the democratic verdict of the British people

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,670
and to secure the best possible outcome for
the prosperity and security of the entire

70
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:42,750
United Kingdom from the negotiations, whereas
the hon. Lady, even just two months ago, was

71
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,150
telling us that she wanted

72
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,010
“to go back to the British people in some
way”.

73
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,050
She needs to decide whether she accepts the
democratic verdict or not.

74
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,090
>>Emily Thornberry: Of course we accept the
democratic decision of the British public—[Hon.

75
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,800
Members: “Ah!”] Of course we do. The difference
between our side of the House and the Government

76
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,560
side is that we want to leave the European
Union on behalf of 100%—on behalf of the

77
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,310
whole of this nation.

78
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,889
We really need a straightforward answer to
a straightforward question. Leaving the customs

79
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,580
union would mean having to check every container
coming in at Dover. It would mean UK firms

80
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,290
having proof of origin tests whenever they
export to Europe. It would mean chaos and

81
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,600
it would mean gridlock for cross-border supply
chains. As the Leader of the House said in

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,120
May, I believe about lamb and beef exports:

83
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,340
“They go tariff free, they go without any
extra…checks…you cannot guarantee any

84
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,010
of that if we are outside.”

85
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,600
Again, Labour Members agree with what he said
six months ago. The question is: does he still

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,510
agree with himself?

87
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:02,889
>>Mr Lidington: I thought it had not escaped
even the hon. Lady’s attention that there

88
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:09,710
has been a rather significant referendum since
February. That changes the context in which

89
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:17,470
we are now having to operate. We face a deep,
challenging and wide-ranging negotiation,

90
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,960
and it would be harmful to the national interest
for me or other Ministers to engage in the

91
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,460
sort of detailed exposition of our negotiating
position that she is now pressing upon me.

92
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,270
None of the other 27 Governments are doing
that; nor should we.

93
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,906
>>Emily Thornberry: Dear oh dear. We are not
asking for details; we are asking about a

94
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:48,260
central plank of the negotiations. If the
right hon. Gentleman cannot give us an answer

95
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,580
on the customs union—[Interruption.]

96
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:56,890
>>Mr Speaker: Order. Both the questions and
the answers will be heard. If the juvenile

97
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,520
behaviour could stop, that would be really
helpful to the scrutiny process.

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,920
>>Emily Thornberry: We have not had an answer
on the customs union as a whole, so may I

99
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,870
ask the right hon. Gentleman a question about
one specific point? Since 1993, there have

100
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,900
been no customs checks on the land border
between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.

101
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,850
In May, when visiting Northern Ireland, he
said that if the UK

102
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,450
“were not part of the customs union…there
would have to be customs checks at the border.”

103
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,920
He also said that for anyone to pretend otherwise

104
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,450
“flies in the face of reality.”

105
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:42,400
Will he confirm that that remains the position?
If that is right, he really must make it clear

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,830
today that the Government are determined to
avoid that situation.

107
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,890
>>Mr Lidington: The Prime Minister and the
Northern Ireland Secretary have repeatedly

108
00:09:51,890 --> 00:10:01,960
made it clear that we want the very long-standing
common travel and free trade arrangements

109
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,800
across the Irish border to continue, as indeed
do the Irish Government. We are actively engaged

110
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,450
in talking both to the Northern Ireland Executive
and to the Government of the Republic of Ireland

111
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,080
about those matters. There is goodwill on
all sides towards trying to reach a solution

112
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,160
that works for people north and south of the
border.

113
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,600
>>Emily Thornberry: The Leader of the House
has made the familiar arguments—he cannot

114
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,580
give answers; it is all to be resolved through
negotiations; Brexit means Brexit; Brexit

115
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,970
means breakfast—but that was not what the
Secretary of State for Brexit said when he

116
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,730
was asked about the customs union in September.
He said that he had looked at the matter carefully

117
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,730
and that

118
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,980
“that is exactly the sort of decision that
we will resolve before we trigger article

119
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,930
50.”—[Official Report, 5 September 2016;
Vol. 614, c. 54.]

120
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,250
If the Government are going to decide their
position on this issue before 31 March, will

121
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,770
the Leader of the House confirm that the British
people and the British Parliament will be

122
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,150
told some answers to my questions before the
Government tell the rest of Europe?

123
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:10,400
>>Mr Lidington: If the answers sound familiar,
it might be because we need constant repetition

124
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,520
before the hon. Lady understands and appreciates
the principal argument. The Government are

125
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:27,480
at the moment engaged in a consultation with
more than 50 sectors of United Kingdom business

126
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,800
to ascertain precisely which aspects of European
Union membership work well for them, which

127
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,560
they see as harmful and where the opportunities
beyond EU membership lie. We will come to

128
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,850
a decision and we will go into negotiations
on behalf of the full 100% of the United Kingdom

129
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,940
population and all four nations of the UK.

130
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,899
>>Emily Thornberry: The fact is—the Leader
of the House knows it, as do we all—that

131
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,660
he can consult as much as he likes, but the
answer will come back that we should be part

132
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,940
of the customs union. It is hugely disappointing
that on a day when the Government are committing

133
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,660
to greater transparency on their intentions
for Brexit, we are getting the usual stonewalling.

134
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,300
We have a Government who are promising to
tell us the plan while refusing to give us

135
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,420
answers to the most basic of questions, and
who are promising to give Parliament a say

136
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,100
while spending we do not know how much taxpayers’
money across the road in the Supreme Court

137
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,180
trying to stop Parliament from having a say
on this. In short, we have a Government who

138
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:38,470
cannot tell us the plan because they do not
have a plan. In February, the Leader of the

139
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:45,930
House said that what he was hearing from the
leave campaign was “confusing, contradictory,

140
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:52,839
nonsense”. My final question is this: are
we hearing anything different from the Government

141
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,149
today?

142
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:05,839
>>Mr Lidington: We will publish, before article
50 is triggered, a statement about our negotiating

143
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:14,560
strategy and objectives, as the Prime Minister
said yesterday. The hon. Lady seems to be

144
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,850
in a state of utter denial about the consequences
that flow from the referendum decision. No

145
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,550
other EU Government are seeking to reverse
or question the legitimacy of that vote in

146
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,351
the way that she and a number of her colleagues
are still trying to do. I am afraid that that

147
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:40,870
just indicates how distant the Labour party
now is from any aspirations to be back in

148
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:49,170
government again. We watch them in action,
quarrelling like “Mutiny on the Bounty”

149
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,820
as re-shot by the “Carry On” team. [Interruption.]

150
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:03,671
>>Mr Speaker: Order. There is far too much
noise. I want to hear the words flowing. There

151
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:09,550
is no reason why the Chair should be denied
the hearing of these matters. It is very important.

152
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,310
>>Mr Lidington: They are rudderless. They
are drifting on Europe, as on so many other

153
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,140
aspects of policy. It is little wonder that
so many decent working people, who for generations

154
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,529
looked to Labour to be their champion, have
given up in despair and are turning to the

155
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:38,480
Conservative party as the authentic voice
of working families.

156
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,580
>Bob Blackman (Harrow East) (Con): In 1943,
a 16-year-old girl was forcibly taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau,

157
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,580
where she witnessed the horrors of the death
camps. On liberation, she came to this country

158
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,640
with her mother. She raised a family and became
a nurse. She dedicated her life to making

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:06,050
sure the people of this country and beyond
know the horrors of the holocaust. Last week,

160
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:24,130
that lady turned 90. Kitty Hart-Moxon is with
us today at Prime Minister’s Question Time.

161
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:38,740
[Applause.] Will my right hon. Friend join
me, and I think the whole House, in wishing

162
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:46,040
Kitty a very happy belated birthday, and thank
her for her lifetime of dedication to raising

163
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,360
this important issue? Will he also pay tribute
to the Holocaust Educational Trust, which

164
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,820
does everything possible to ensure we all
remember and bear witness to the horrors of

165
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,720
the worst part of the 20th century?

166
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:10,000
>>Mr Lidington: First, I am grateful to my
hon. Friend for raising this important issue.

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,100
I would like to join him in marking the achievements
of Kitty Hart-Moxon and the Holocaust Educational

168
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,670
Trust. I can never forget the impact of discovering,
as a schoolboy, that two of the boys in my

169
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:30,390
class had fathers who survived Auschwitz.
It is only a couple of generations ago that

170
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,940
Europe was plunged into this unspeakable horror.
It is important that not just the Holocaust

171
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,351
Educational Trust but all of us play our part
in ensuring that the memory of the holocaust

172
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:48,970
lives on, and that the wider lessons of that
dark period in our history are learned. I

173
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,959
would be grateful for the support of all Members,
right across the House from all political

174
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,340
parties, in working together to ensure that
that vital work continues.

175
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,639
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): Some of the
most deprived communities in the country are

176
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:12,558
in Glasgow, yet today we learn that apparently
the Government plan to close jobcentres in

177
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,220
those very communities, in Parkhead, Bridgeton,
Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Langside, Anniesland,

178
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:27,459
Cambuslang and Maryhill. Is it true that the
Government are planning to close these important

179
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,049
offices and bring misery to the lives of the
many tens of thousands of people in Glasgow

180
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,149
who currently use these centres?

181
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:40,639
>>Mr Lidington: Clearly, the Department for
Work and Pensions, like every Department,

182
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:46,350
looks from time to time at its estate and
the number of offices it has, but the right

183
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,840
hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable
point on behalf of people in Glasgow. I will

184
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,299
ask my right hon. Friend the Work and Pensions
Secretary to contact him with the details

185
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,299
he is seeking.

186
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:11,580
>>Angus Robertson: I am sorry but that is
not good enough. [Interruption.] I am being

187
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:25,970
heckled while standing up for deprived communities.
That will ill behove Tory Members in Scotland.

188
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:36,149
The Leader of the House is correct that the
Department has plans to cut the estate by

189
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:48,299
20%, but it is planning to cut it by 50% in
Glasgow. Why are the Government planning disproportionately

190
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:54,559
to cut vital jobcentres in some of the most
deprived communities in our country?

191
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:02,869
>>Mr Lidington: The key element in any such
decision that a Department has to make is

192
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:09,220
not the raw number of offices there should
be but how accessible the offices and the

193
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,409
services they provide continue to be for the
people who need to use them. I am absolutely

194
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:24,580
confident that that criterion is at the heart
of my right hon. Friend’s thinking in planning

195
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,399
for the future of offices in Scotland and
everywhere else in the United Kingdom.

196
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:35,549
>>Amanda Milling (Cannock Chase) (Con): Passengers
on the Chase line face chaos and utter misery

197
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:41,470
every autumn, and this year it has been worse
than ever. Delayed, cancelled and overcrowded

198
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,739
trains are leaving passengers stranded at
stations and making them late for work and

199
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:51,529
school. Will my right hon. Friend outline
what measures the Government are taking to

200
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,850
penalise poor-performing train operators?

201
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:02,360
>>Mr Lidington: I sympathise with my hon.
Friend and her constituents, and all passengers

202
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,239
who come across these problems on the Chase
line. It is clearly unacceptable, and it is

203
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:13,850
important that the operator works hard to
secure a rapid and sustained improvement.

204
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,710
The Government have introduced new rules to
ensure that rail passengers will soon be able

205
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,600
to claim compensation if their train is more
than 15 minutes late, but as the Transport

206
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,510
Secretary said yesterday, more needs to be
done, and we want to see much closer working

207
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,539
right across the railway industry so that
this kind of problem can be resolved much

208
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:33,660
more swiftly.

209
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,739
>>Deidre Brock (Edinburgh North and Leith)
(SNP): Does the Leader of the House agree

210
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:43,700
with the hon. Member for North East Somerset
(Mr Rees-Mogg) that Brexit offers an opportunity

211
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,450
to remove pesky emissions standards? In the
red, white and blue of Brexit, will his Government

212
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,590
still commit to continued tough targets to
protect our environment, or will tackling

213
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,840
global warming become just a load of hot air?

214
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:09,630
>>Mr Lidington: The Government remain utterly
committed to both national and global ambitions

215
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:16,840
and targets on climate change. Indeed, my
right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, in her

216
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,729
previous job, played a key role in brokering
the Paris agreement last year—the first

217
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:27,979
ever global agreement on climate change. I
hope that the hon. Lady would welcome the

218
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:34,570
fact that we are going to be ahead of our
targets and ambitions in delivering on the

219
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,879
proportion of electricity provided by renewables
in this country and that we continue to work

220
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,470
to get our carbon emissions down.

221
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:49,679
>>Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con): There
has been much talk recently about paying for

222
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:57,669
access to a tariff-free single market. I think
that that is a very good idea. Given that

223
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:06,100
the UK is the fifth-biggest economy in the
world and we have a £70 billion trade deficit

224
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:20,229
with the EU, would the excellent acting Prime
Minister tell the House how much the EU should

225
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:28,359
pay for tariff-free access to the UK’s single
market?

226
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:37,419
>>Mr Lidington: I thank my hon. Friend for
the upgrade, but I hope that that does not

227
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:45,070
turn out to be a career-limiting compliment.
He makes a good point in that a settlement

228
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,080
at the end of our negotiations that maintains
maximum access to and freedom to operate within

229
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,559
the European market—for UK companies elsewhere
in Europe and European companies here—is

230
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,359
in our mutual interest. I hope that will inspire
negotiators on both sides.

231
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:06,820
>>Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP): How
does closing Maryhill jobcentre in my constituency,

232
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,389
one of the most deprived parts of the country,
help my constituents who want to find a job?

233
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,830
Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that
travelling further to other centres will mean

234
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,080
increased costs for people already on the
lowest incomes and an increased risk of sanctions?

235
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,409
Why do the Government continue to target the
poorest and most vulnerable in our society?

236
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,210
>>Mr Lidington: If the Government have been
targeting the poorest and most vulnerable,

237
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:37,539
it has been to get them back to work in record
numbers and to provide a boost to the pay

238
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:42,529
of people on low incomes through the introduction
of and the increase in the national living

239
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,200
wage. I wish the hon. Gentleman was prepared
to welcome and celebrate those achievements.

240
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,129
>>Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire)
(Con): As we are about to commence the most

241
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:59,389
important negotiation for decades, does my
right hon. Friend agree that forcing the Government

242
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:03,830
to disclose their negotiating strategy at
this stage is rather like showing one’s

243
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:10,359
hand of cards to an opponent before a game
of poker. I urge him to take no advice from

244
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,539
the Labour party; it has only one card to
play—and it is always the joker.

245
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:22,999
>>Mr Lidington: We have always said that we
would come up with some more details about

246
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,980
our strategic aims going into the negotiation,
but it would harm our national interest if

247
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,289
we were to go into the sort of detailed explanation
of our negotiating position that the Opposition

248
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:39,509
urge upon us. That is not how any of the other
27 Governments are either acting or thinking,

249
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:41,840
and we should learn from that example.

250
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,640
>>Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP): Does
the Leader of the House agree that tonight’s

251
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,279
vote on the Prime Minister’s amendment,
which we fully support, is a vote of the highest

252
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,210
significance and greatest importance, because
for the first time right hon. and hon. Members

253
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,479
will have the opportunity to vote on whether
they respect the will of the people of the

254
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:09,389
United Kingdom and whether they will get on
and implement it? People will be able to read

255
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:17,490
in tomorrow’s Hansard who stands by respecting
the will of the people of the United Kingdom.

256
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:23,599
Does he also agree—I am sure he will—that
the more red, white and blue he makes it,

257
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,460
the better for us on the Unionist Benches?

258
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:37,840
>>Mr Lidington: As so often, the right hon.
Gentleman makes a powerful and important point.

259
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,190
The vote tonight will be the first opportunity
for Members to decide whether or not they

260
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:52,919
support the Government’s timetable for triggering
article 50 by the end of March 2017. Any right

261
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,119
hon. or hon. Member who votes against that
motion will, in my view, be seeking to thwart

262
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,190
the outcome of the referendum in the most
profoundly undemocratic fashion.

263
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:08,809
>>Kit Malthouse (North West Hampshire) (Con):
This country’s nuclear deterrent is our

264
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,099
ultimate defence, and it must be maintained
at all costs, yet hundreds of my constituents

265
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,769
who work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment
are currently on strike or work to rule in

266
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:23,320
a dispute over pensions. These are people
who, more often than not, have devoted their

267
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,509
entire working lives tending our nuclear defence
and to whom promises were made during privatisation.

268
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,870
Will the Leader of the House commit to sit
down with the Prime Minister to review the

269
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,130
situation to ensure that those promises are
being kept?

270
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:44,429
>>Mr Lidington: I will certainly ensure that
my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is

271
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,470
informed about this matter. My hon. Friend
is absolutely right to raise these concerns

272
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,070
on behalf of his constituents. My understanding
is that the proposed changes to the Atomic

273
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,460
Weapons Establishment pension scheme are a
matter for the company as the employer, but

274
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,489
I can assure my hon. Friend that my right
hon. Friend the Defence Secretary has been

275
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:07,690
in close contact with AWE throughout the process
and has also met the trade unions. He is now

276
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,840
carefully considering recent developments
to see what else might be done.

277
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,559
>>Anna Turley (Redcar) (Lab/Co-op): I know
that the whole House will join me in sending

278
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,179
heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the
family of David Brown, from Eston, who, aged

279
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:28,100
just 18, took his own life. The inquest into
his death has heard that he did so on the

280
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,409
day he was due to sign on at the jobcentre,
after saying that he felt “belittled”

281
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:37,669
by staff despite actively looking for work
and seeking an apprenticeship. Shortly before

282
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,719
taking his own life, he told his mum:

283
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:44,529
“The way the Jobcentre treat people, it
is no surprise people commit suicide.”

284
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:49,349
Will the Leader of the House undertake to
review that individual case? Will he also

285
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:54,049
undertake to take stock of six years of brutal
welfare reform, and look into the way the

286
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:58,179
Department for Work and Pensions treats its
most vulnerable constituents, particularly

287
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,039
young people?

288
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:08,799
>>Mr Lidington: Let me first express my own
unreserved sympathy for the family of David

289
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,840
Brown. No parent, no family, should have to
go through that kind of shocking experience.

290
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:26,450
Clearly, human beings in any organisation
sometimes make decisions that get things wrong,

291
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,490
and I will ask the Department for Work and
Pensions to have a look at the particular

292
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:36,039
case that the hon. Lady has described. However,
I have to say to her that I think the principle

293
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,759
remains right that while staff should always
behave with courtesy towards people seeking

294
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:48,460
to claim benefits, it is also right for us
to expect people who are receiving benefits

295
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,999
to be subject to the kind of disciplines that
apply to people in work even if they are on

296
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:58,070
low pay. There is a principle of fairness
here, which is what lies behind the approach

297
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,519
that the DWP takes.

298
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,349
>>Rehman Chishti (Gillingham and Rainham)
(Con): I applaud the Prime Minister’s vision

299
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:08,100
of a Government for all, but, as chair of
the all-party parliamentary group for communities

300
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,849
engagement, I can tell the House that fewer
than 4% of those on the boards of the companies

301
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:19,080
in the FTSE 150 are from ethnic minorities.
Will the Government support a vision of helping

302
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,450
to increase that proportion to 10% by 2021?

303
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:29,120
>>Mr Lidington: It is clear that boardrooms
should do more to reflect the reality of modern

304
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,359
Britain. The Government certainly support
the principle of increasing the diversity

305
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,769
of boards, which is why we are supporting
the business-led ethnic diversity initiative

306
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:43,429
chaired by Sir John Parker. We strongly encourage
businesses to act on Sir John’s recommendations.

307
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:49,109
>>Tracy Brabin (Batley and Spen) (Lab): The
response to a recent freedom of information

308
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:54,320
request shows that Pinderfields hospital has
diverted ambulances destined for its accident

309
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,710
and emergency department to Dewsbury hospital,
in my constituency, 61 times in the past 12

310
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,979
months. Dewsbury is scheduled for a downgrade
next year. In the light of evidence showing

311
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:13,289
that Pinderfields cannot currently cope, will
the Leader of the House pledge urgent Government

312
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,580
support to keep Dewsbury A&amp;E open?

313
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:23,970
>>Mr Lidington: The NHS is certainly busier
than it has ever been in its history, which

314
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:32,070
is why it should be a matter of thanks and
tribute to hard-working NHS staff that 90%

315
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,739
of people going to A&amp;E are still being
seen within the four-hour target. The point

316
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:44,879
about the configuration of local services
in any part of the country is that they need

317
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:51,360
to be driven by local clinicians through trusts
working together with the clinical commissioning

318
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,839
groups, who manage and understand what is
needed in each locality. Local authorities,

319
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:03,129
through their health committees, have the
right to call in proposed changes in services

320
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:07,690
and refer them to the Secretary of State if
they are uncomfortable with them.

321
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,659
>>Craig Williams (Cardiff North) (Con): I
know that my right hon. Friend will agree

322
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:16,129
with me about the importance of the creative
sector to our economy. That, in conjunction

323
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:21,031
with the Welsh language, makes S4C, or Sianel
Pedwar Cymru—which is currently based in

324
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:26,629
my constituency—hugely important to the
Welsh and British culture and economy. Will

325
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:31,509
my right hon. Friend reaffirm the Government’s
commitment to protecting the S4C budget while

326
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:33,610
we review the future of the Welsh language
broadcaster?

327
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,049
>>Mr Lidington: We are fully committed to
the future of Welsh language broadcasting,

328
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,330
and to S4C. I am pleased to say that the licence
fee settlement that we have agreed has provided

329
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,960
financial certainty, protecting S4C’s funding
at more than £74 million a year for the next

330
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,589
five years. We are absolutely committed to
ensuring that the channel continues to make

331
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:58,200
first-class shows and serve Welsh-speaking
audiences in my hon. Friend’s constituency,

332
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,559
and, for that matter, throughout the United
Kingdom.

333
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,080
>>Naz Shah (Bradford West) (Lab): Is the Leader
of the House aware of reports of Rohingyan

334
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,140
children being massacred and thrown into fires,
of Rohingyan women being raped, and of houses

335
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,940
being razed to the ground? What representations
have the Government made to the Burmese authorities

336
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,830
or the military in that regard?

337
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:26,039
>>Mr Lidington: Those reports from Rohingya
are extremely concerning. As the hon. Lady

338
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:34,859
knows, there is a long history of discrimination
against the Rohingya people in Burma. British

339
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:40,909
Ministers and the British embassy and officials
in London make our concern very clear at regular

340
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,450
intervals to the Burmese authorities.

341
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,269
>>Steve Double (St Austell and Newquay) (Con):
Following the revelations in the BBC “Panorama”

342
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:52,330
programme, Clinton House in my constituency
is now closed. Three further care homes run

343
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,269
by the Morleigh Group have now been rated
as inadequate by the Care Quality Commission

344
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:00,889
and two others are under inspection. Concerns
have been raised about these care homes for

345
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:05,919
many years, and it cannot be acceptable that
it took the BBC to provoke the action that

346
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,759
was desperately needed. Does the Leader of
the House agree that it is now time to urgently

347
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:16,279
review the role of the CQC to ensure that
in future concerns raised by residents, families

348
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,499
and staff are properly and promptly addressed?

349
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:26,539
>>Mr Lidington: Older and vulnerable people
deserve the highest quality care possible.

350
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,080
There is no excuse for services that fall
short of expectations in the way my hon. Friend

351
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,489
has described. The CQC has extensive powers
in law to ensure that nobody in the chain

352
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:45,149
of responsibility is immune to legal accountability,
and I would expect the CQC to exercise those

353
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:51,519
powers in full in this case. But my hon. Friend
has made some criticisms of the CQC and the

354
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,450
Government have been looking into ways to
improve its processes and increase its efficiency.

355
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,779
The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my
hon. Friend the Member for Warrington South

356
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,339
(David Mowat), is the Minister responsible
for community health and care, and he discussed

357
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,750
this very issue with the CQC earlier today.

358
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:08,330
>>Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op):
US satellite data show that 6% of methane

359
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:14,659
from fracking is leaked through fugitive emissions.
Given that methane is 86 times worse than

360
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,030
CO2 for global warming over a 20-year timeframe,
will the right hon. Gentleman support the

361
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:28,020
Council of Europe’s call for the banning
of fracking, or at least for a maximum of

362
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,010
0.1% fugitive emissions at the wellhead?

363
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,910
>>Mr Lidington: No, Mr Speaker. The Government
took their decision to give a go-ahead to

364
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:43,359
fracking after extensive consideration of
both the economic and the environmental risks

365
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,580
and opportunities involved. We are confident
that fracking can be carried out in a way

366
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:55,070
that is safe and does not harm the environment,
but which also provides job opportunities

367
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:00,270
for this country and makes us less dependent
on the import of energy.

368
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:07,060
>>Mr Steve Baker (Wycombe) (Con): I expect
my right hon. Friend will be astonished, if

369
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:13,860
not aghast, to learn that a succession of
journalists from the BBC have contacted me

370
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:20,140
seeking to create—to manufacture—stories
of Back-Bench rebellion on the issue of the

371
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,810
EU. [Interruption.] Will he—[Interruption.]

372
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,430
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I want to hear about
these activities.

373
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:35,230
>>Mr Baker: Does my right hon. Friend agree
with me that on these controversial issues

374
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:42,630
the BBC should stick to its charter obligations
on accuracy and impartiality, instead of seeking

375
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,370
to create problems for the Government?

376
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:59,450
>>Mr Lidington: I am sure that my hon. Friend
is shocked at the thought that anybody should

377
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:04,630
look to him as a source of information about
rebellions against the Government. I hope

378
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,900
he will be able to find some comfort in the
fact that the new royal charter and agreement

379
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,520
require the BBC to deliver impartial news—the
very first time impartiality has been enshrined

380
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
in the BBC’s mission.

381
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,140
>>Carolyn Harris (Swansea East) (Lab): Having
now received a response from the Prime Minister

382
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,560
to my request for a children’s funeral fund,
I was disturbed to be told that the social

383
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,620
fund could provide a “simple and respectful
funeral.” This answer is both insensitive

384
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:41,320
and totally lacks any understanding of my
original request. Has the Leader of the House

385
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,290
the authority to facilitate a meeting with
me and other bereaved mothers, so that we

386
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,580
can explain to the Prime Minister exactly
what we are asking for? This request is important

387
00:36:53,580 --> 00:37:01,640
to us as parents, many in this House and,
judging from my postbag, many people and organisations

388
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,610
across the country.

389
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:13,560
>>Mr Lidington: Burying a child must be an
incredibly painful experience for any family,

390
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:23,740
and I think we all pay respect to, and have
enormous sympathy with, the hon. Member for

391
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:28,900
Swansea East (Carolyn Harris). She says she
speaks on behalf of thousands of parents who

392
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,400
have had to go through that anguish. As the
Prime Minister has said, there are mechanisms

393
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,440
in place for making financial support available
from central Government, and local authorities

394
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:48,670
are of course free to waive funeral fees for
child burials, and many of them do so. I will

395
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:54,260
talk to my ministerial colleagues about the
hon. Lady’s request for a meeting, and I

396
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,740
am sure that she will receive a response to
that.

397
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,400
>>Richard Graham (Gloucester) (Con): Good
train links are vital in enabling our constituents

398
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,850
to get to work. It is therefore incredibly
frustrating for my constituents that, of the

399
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,950
63 services a day that CrossCountry operates
between Birmingham and Bristol, only three

400
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,261
stop at the city of Gloucester on the way.
Will my right hon. Friend ensure that when

401
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:20,410
Ministers extend the train operator’s franchise,
they do not allow CrossCountry to go on treating

402
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,920
Gloucester like a leper to be avoided at all
costs, and that they instead oblige the company

403
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,500
to deliver the kind of service that every
city deserves?

404
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:35,630
>>Mr Lidington: My hon. Friend is as always
speaking up strongly on behalf of his constituents.

405
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,140
Any of us who have been to Gloucester will
know that it is a place we want to be able

406
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:45,030
to visit frequently and easily. The Government
are investing record amounts in improving

407
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:51,100
our railways and, in his particular case,
Transport Ministers are working with CrossCountry

408
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,230
and Great Western to see how the Gloucester
service can be improved.
