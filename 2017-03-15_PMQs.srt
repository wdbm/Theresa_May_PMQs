1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,860
>> Huw Merriman (Bexhill and Battle) (Con):
If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,640
for Wednesday 15 March.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,360
>> The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May):
I am sure that Members will want to join me

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,750
in wishing people across the UK and around
the world a happy St Patrick’s day this

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,650
coming Friday. This morning, I had meetings
with ministerial colleagues and others. In

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,960
addition to my duties in this House, I shall
have further such meetings later today.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,200
>> Huw Merriman:
With my Irish blood, may I also wish people

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,870
a happy St Patrick’s day?

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,510
I welcome the Government’s announcement
that we will abide by the letter of our manifesto

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:51,370
and also the spirit. Does the Prime Minister
agree that, as we move towards balancing the

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,620
books, we must ensure that we have a fair
and sustainable tax system?

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,679
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my hon. Friend for his question. We

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:09,490
made a commitment not to raise tax, and we
put our commitment into the tax lock. The

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:23,520
measures that we put forward in the Budget
last week were consistent with those locks.

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,340
As a number of my parliamentary colleagues
have been pointing out in recent days—[Interruption.]

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,689
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. This is intolerable. [Interruption.]

17
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:44,520
I take no view on the matter, but I do take
a view on the importance of hearing the questions

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
and the answers.

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,600
>> The Prime Minister:
As a number of my parliamentary colleagues

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,469
have been pointing out in recent days, the
trend towards greater self-employment does

21
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:59,299
create a structural issue in the tax base
on which we will have to act. We want to ensure

22
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:05,890
that we maintain, as they have said, fairness
in the tax system. We will await the report

23
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,470
from Matthew Taylor on the future of employment;
consider the Government’s overall approach

24
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,660
to employment status and rights to tax and
entitlements; and bring forward further proposals,

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,580
but we will not bring forward increases to
national insurance contributions later in

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,870
this Parliament.

27
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:34,640
>> Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab):
First, may I wish everyone in my constituency,

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,600
in Ireland and all around the world a very
happy St Patrick’s day on the 17th?

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,450
We have just heard that the Prime Minister
is about to drop the national insurance hike

30
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,790
announced only a week ago. It seems to me
that the Government are in a bit of chaos

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:03:04,560
here with a Budget that unravels in seven
days, a Conservative manifesto with a pensive

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Prime Minister on the front page saying that
there would be no increase, and a week ago

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,710
an increase being announced. If they are to
drop the increase, as they are indicating,

34
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:23,950
the Prime Minister should thank the Federation
of Small Businesses and all those who have

35
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:32,480
pointed out both how unfair the increase would
be and how big business evades an awful lot

36
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,870
of national insurance through bogus self-employment.

37
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,040
>> The Prime Minister:
I do not think the right hon. Gentleman listened

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,650
to the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the
Member for Bexhill and Battle (Huw Merriman).

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,920
I normally stand at this Dispatch Box and
say I will not take any lectures from the

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,890
right hon. Gentleman, but when it comes to
lectures on chaos he would be the first person

41
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,069
I turned to.

42
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:06,020
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
I think the Prime Minister should offer an

43
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,650
apology for the chaos that her Government
have caused during the past week and the stress

44
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,800
they have caused to the 4.8 million self-employed
people in this country. Will she offer that

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,650
apology? Her hon. Friend the Under-Secretary
of State for Wales did so a week ago; it is

46
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:34,060
time she joined him. This measure, if carried
through, will create a black hole in the budget.

47
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,390
What is she going to do to fill that black
hole?

48
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:44,370
>> The Prime Minister:
If the right hon. Gentleman is so concerned

49
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:51,650
about balancing the books, why is it Labour
party policy to borrow half a trillion pounds

50
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,720
and bankrupt Britain?

51
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:09,840
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Given that this Government propose to borrow

52
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,420
more between now and 2020 than the entire
borrowing of all Labour Governments put together,

53
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:24,860
we do not need lectures from them on that.
I hope that in his statement later today the

54
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:33,220
Chancellor will address the question of injustice
to many people who are forced into bogus self-employment

55
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:41,000
by unscrupulous companies, many of which force
their workers to become self-employed and

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,320
thereby avoid employer’s national insurance
contributions. It is a grossly unfair system

57
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,321
where those in self-employment pay some national
insurance, but employers do not, and benefit

58
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:57,169
from it. That is a gross injustice that must
be addressed.

59
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,430
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman obviously has not

60
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,440
noticed that one of the first things I did
when I became Prime Minister was commission

61
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,620
Matthew Taylor of the RSA to conduct a review
of the employment market and employment rights

62
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,070
and status, precisely because we recognised
that the employment market is changing. He

63
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,000
talks about the self-employed, so let us look
at what we have done for the self-employed.

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,610
Our increase in the personal allowance means
that they now keep more of their earnings.

65
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,161
They will have access to both tax-free childcare
and 30 hours of free childcare a week, just

66
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:39,760
like employees, and now they have access to
the new state pension, worth over £1,800

67
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,710
more a year. What we know is that the Labour
party’s policies would bankrupt Britain

68
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,099
and put firms out of business and people out
of jobs.

69
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:54,780
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
We have a Government U-turn, no apology, and

70
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:04,580
a Budget that falls most heavily on those
with the least broad shoulders, with cuts

71
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,330
to schools, cuts to social care and cuts to
support for people with disabilities. That

72
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,500
is the agenda of the right hon. Lady’s Government,
and everybody knows it.

73
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,460
>> The Prime Minister:
I do not think the right hon. Gentleman has

74
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:38,820
got the hang of this. He is supposed to ask
me a question when he stands up—[Interruption.]

75
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,880
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. Let us hear the answer.

76
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,660
>> The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman talks about schools.

77
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,370
What have we done? We have protected the core
schools budget and introduced the pupil premium.

78
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,860
This Budget delivers money for more than 100
new schools, ensuring good school places for

79
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,790
every child. This Budget delivers on skills
for young people; we want them to be equipped

80
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,611
for the jobs of the future. The Budget delivers
£500 million for technical education. We

81
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:15,230
also recognise the pressure on social care.
This Budget delivers £2 billion more funding

82
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,670
for social care—funding that would not be
available with Labour’s economic policies.

83
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,570
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
It would be a very good idea if the Prime

84
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,290
Minister listened to headteachers all over
the country, who are desperately trying to

85
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,260
work out how to balance the books in their
schools, but are losing teachers, losing teaching

86
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,310
assistants and losing support for their children
because school budgets are being cut. She

87
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,520
knows that. We all know that. Everybody out
there knows that. They also know that, according

88
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,830
to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
average working families will be £1,400 worse

89
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:02,150
off as a result of her Budget that was produced
last week. What is she doing to help the worst

90
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,400
off and poorest in our society, rather than
continuing to cut local government and schools

91
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,240
expenditure, and to underfund social care?

92
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,860
>> The Prime Minister:
I will tell the right hon. Gentleman what

93
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,810
we have delivered for the low paid. We have
frozen VAT and fuel duty, and every basic

94
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:25,730
rate taxpayer has had a tax cut worth £1,000.
We have taken more than 3 million people out

95
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,220
of paying income tax altogether. That is what
we have done for the low paid. On schools,

96
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,820
1.8 million more children are now in good
or outstanding schools. I want a good school

97
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,420
place for every child. We have done it with
free schools and academies, and with our changes

98
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,320
to education—all opposed by the Labour party.
Now it wants to oppose our giving every child

99
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,760
a good school place. What do we know about
the Labour party’s policies? Well, the former

100
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,950
shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Nottingham
East (Chris Leslie) said that Labour’s policies

101
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:06,149
would mean doubling national insurance, doubling
VAT and doubling council tax. That would not

102
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:12,240
help the low paid or ordinary working families.

103
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,850
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
The difference is that we want a good school

104
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:25,580
and a good place for every child in every
school in every community. Selective education—the

105
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,420
reintroduction of grammar schools—does not
achieve that. We want a staircase for all,

106
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,760
not a ladder for the few, which is what Conservative
policies actually are. The Prime Minister

107
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:46,200
has also not addressed the unfairness of a
Budget that cuts tax at the top end, continues

108
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:54,040
to reduce corporation tax and encourages bogus
self-employment. She has to address the issues

109
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,420
of injustice and inequality in our society,
and of a Government who are dedicated to widening

110
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,260
the gap, not helping the hard-up or those
who are working as self-employed, trying to

111
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,950
make ends meet and not getting access to any
benefits at the same time.

112
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,860
>> The Prime Minister:
Inequality has gone down under this Government.

113
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,420
The Budget shows that the top 1% of earners
will actually contribute 27% in terms of the

114
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,350
income that they are providing. Let me address
the issue of schools. The problem with what

115
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,839
the right hon. Gentleman says is that the
Labour party has opposed, and continues to

116
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,160
oppose, every single education policy brought
forward by this Government, delivering more

117
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:47,500
good school places for children. The Labour
party’s approach is that parents shall take

118
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:55,340
what they are given, good or bad. We believe
in listening to parents.

119
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,380
Let us look ahead to what the right hon. Gentleman’s
policies would produce for this country: half

120
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,360
a trillion pounds of borrowing—£500 billion
more borrowing under the Labour party—more

121
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,390
taxes, more spending and more borrowing. It
would be a bankrupt Britain that would not

122
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,330
give money for public services or help ordinary
working families. It is the Conservative party

123
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,690
that is helping ordinary working families.
It is the Labour party that is failing to

124
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,640
address the needs of the people of this country.
We are delivering. He is just sitting there

125
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,350
or going on protest marches.

126
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,580
>> Jeremy Quin (Horsham) (Con):
As the facts change, I change my question.

127
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:55,440
May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on
proposing the most radical reform of 

128
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,130
technical education in a generation and delivering
fair funding for all our schools? However,

129
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:09,529
may I ask her, as part of the consultation,
to ensure a minimum level of appropriate funding

130
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,649
for all schools?

131
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,480
>> The Prime Minister:
I thank my hon. Friend, because he has raised

132
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,209
an important point. One of the issues we have
addressed in the Budget is putting more money

133
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,790
into skills training—into further education
and technical education—for young people.

134
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,860
I think that one of the most important things
we can do is equip young people for their

135
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,470
futures, and for the jobs of the future, so
that they can get on in life. We are investing

136
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,920
an extra half a billion pounds a year, as
I said earlier, in England’s technical education

137
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,390
system to do this.

138
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,930
My hon. Friend referred to the issue of a
minimum funding level. My right hon. Friend

139
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,980
the Education Secretary confirmed last month
that the Department for Education has heard

140
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,811
representations on this issue. It is considering
these issues, but the funding formula is a

141
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:59,550
complex issue that has needed addressing for
some time, and we will be looking at it carefully.

142
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,110
>> Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):
We once had a Prime Minister who said,

143
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,730
“The lady’s not for turning.”

144
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,160
My goodness, is it not welcome that the Prime
Minister has today admitted that she is for

145
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:24,020
turning, with her screeching, embarrassing
U-turn on national insurance contributions?

146
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:30,310
Only days remain until the Prime Minister
is going to invoke article 50 on leaving the

147
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:38,500
European Union. Last July, she promised to
secure a UK-wide approach—an agreement between

148
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,089
the devolved Administrations of Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland and the UK Government—before

149
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:53,230
triggering article 50, so when will the Prime
Minister announce the details of the agreement?

150
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,300
>> The Prime Minister:
As I said to the right hon. Gentleman yesterday,

151
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,690
and to others asking me questions on the timetable
yesterday, we will trigger article 50 by the

152
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,690
end of March. There will be an opportunity
for further discussions with the devolved

153
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:14,040
Administrations over that period. On the issue
of membership of the European Union, and his

154
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,450
view on Scotland not being a member of the
United Kingdom, I say this to him: he is comparing

155
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,850
membership of an organisation that we have
been a member of for 40 years with our country.

156
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,920
We have been one country for over 300 years;
we have fought together, we have worked together,

157
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,880
we have achieved together, and constitutional
game-playing must not be allowed to break

158
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:54,690
the deep bonds of our shared history and our
future together.

159
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:02,810
>> Angus Robertson:
The Prime Minister can wag her finger as much

160
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:11,190
as she likes; last year, she made a promise:
she promised an agreement. I asked her about

161
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:18,880
it yesterday; she did not answer. I have asked
her about it now; she has not answered. When

162
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,990
will she reach an agreement—not discussions—with
the Scottish Government before triggering

163
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,450
article 50? She has another opportunity. [Interruption.]

164
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:37,339
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. I recognise the passions—[Interruption.]

165
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,410
Mr Wishart, calm yourself, man. I am perfectly
capable of doing this without your beneficent

166
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,959
assistance. The right hon. Member for Moray
(Angus Robertson) will be heard, however long

167
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,360
it takes. [Interruption.] Yes, he will; he
will continue, however long it takes. Carry

168
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
on, Mr Robertson.

169
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,750
>> Angus Robertson:
The Prime Minister promised an agreement;

170
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,150
there is not an agreement. When will there
be an agreement? Does she not understand that

171
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:07,959
if she does not secure an agreement before
triggering article 50—if she is not prepared

172
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,449
to negotiate on behalf of the Scottish Government
and secure membership of the single European

173
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:20,369
market—people in Scotland will have a referendum,
and we will have our say?

174
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:28,238
>> The Prime Minister:
We have been in discussions with the Scottish

175
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:35,109
Government and with the other devolved Administrations
about the interests that they have as we prepare,

176
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:40,659
as the United Kingdom Government, to negotiate
a deal on behalf of the whole of the United

177
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:47,899
Kingdom—a deal that will be a good deal
for not just England, Wales and Northern Ireland,

178
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:55,639
but the people of Scotland as well. As we
go forward in negotiating that deal, I think

179
00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:02,259
the right hon. Gentleman should remember this:
Scotland will be leaving the European Union,

180
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:08,429
either as a member of the United Kingdom or
if it were independent, as it is very clear

181
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:12,960
from the Barroso document that it would not
be a member of the European Union. What we

182
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,419
need now is to unite, come together as a country,
and ensure that we can get the best deal for

183
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,649
the whole of the United Kingdom.

184
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:32,760
>> Mr Andrew Turner (Isle of Wight) (Con):
This Government are working with local enterprise

185
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,350
partnerships, councils and other partners
to grow the economy, but despite being in

186
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:48,779
the prosperous south-east, the Isle of Wight
is 339th out of 379 in the UK competitiveness

187
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:58,629
index. Will my right hon. Friend ensure that
more growth funding is targeted at rural areas

188
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:04,860
such as the island, with its many small and
microbusinesses, to deliver a country that

189
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,440
works for all?

190
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,119
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend speaks well on behalf of his

191
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,549
constituents, and he is right to do that.
I know that he has consistently put forward

192
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:22,440
the unique characteristics of the Isle of
Wight. We have already been able to support

193
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,600
the island’s economy through the local growth
deal for the Solent—that is £183 million—and

194
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,989
the Solent local enterprise partnership has
been supporting the Isle of Wight rural small

195
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:34,720
and medium-sized enterprise programme; my
hon. Friend particularly referred to rural

196
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,200
funding. I want to make sure that we make
the best of the diverse strengths of all Britain’s

197
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,869
cities, regions and islands. I am sure that
on the island, the business community and

198
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,600
the council will work together to create the
best possible conditions for growth and competitiveness

199
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
in the future.

200
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,559
>> Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth)
(Lab/Co-op):

201
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,889
Our two single markets are the backbone of
our economy, yet the Prime Minister wants

202
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:02,519
to rip us away from one, and the Scottish
National party wants to break up the other.

203
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,659
Is the risky and reckless approach she is
taking to Brexit really a price worth paying

204
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:13,620
to foster the break-up of Britain?

205
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,229
>> The Prime Minister:
The hon. Gentleman is wrong when he says that

206
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:25,759
I want to rip the United Kingdom away from
the single market. What we want to do—[Interruption.]

207
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,909
I am sorry to say to hon. Members on the Labour
Benches that this is the same answer that

208
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:36,899
I have given consistently in this House. We
want to ensure that we get a good free trade

209
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:41,840
agreement that gives us the maximum possible
access to the single market, to enable us

210
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,009
to trade with the single market and operate
within the single market.

211
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:48,340
>> Mrs Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet)
(Con):

212
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,350
I welcome the support on business rates being
given by the Budget to local high streets,

213
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,539
which are so crucially valued in places such
as my constituency of Barnet. Does the Prime

214
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,740
Minister agree that we can give more help
to small businesses if we secure the international

215
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,890
agreement we need to ensure that all big businesses
pay their taxes?

216
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,159
>> The Prime Minister
This is a very important issue, and one on

217
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,149
which I think this Government have a record
of which we can be proud, but of course there

218
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:22,600
is more to do. Since 2010, through the work
we have done on tackling tax evasion, avoidance

219
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,820
and non-compliance, we have secured an additional
£140 billion in compliance yield. Internationally,

220
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,840
we have driven the global agenda. We have
now got 100 countries signed up to the automatic

221
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,759
exchange of financial account information,
and we have pushed G7 and G20 partners to

222
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,770
establish registers of beneficial ownership,
but my right hon. Friend is right: there is

223
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,850
more to do. We will continue to crack down
on big companies not paying their tax. I want

224
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,739
to see an economy that works for everyone,
and that means that big companies should be

225
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:54,100
paying their tax as well as everybody else.

226
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,169
>> Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):
In answer to my right hon. Friend the Member

227
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:03,570
for Moray (Angus Robertson), the Prime Minister
called for respect, but that is a two-way

228
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,259
street. Where is her Government’s respect
for the Scottish Government’s compromise

229
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,419
proposal, which has just been ignored in these
negotiations?

230
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:17,090
>> The Prime Minister:
The compromise proposal has not been ignored;

231
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,860
it has been discussed by Ministers with Ministers
from the Scottish Government. There are many

232
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,519
areas within that proposal on which we agree,
as I have said before, such as on ensuring

233
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,619
our security from crime and terrorism, and
maintaining and protecting workers’ rights.

234
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:36,379
>> Will Quince (Colchester) (Con):
Colchester hospital’s A and E department

235
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:42,409
has excellent staff, but suffers from poor
layout and patient flow. Does the Prime Minister

236
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:48,350
agree with me that the £100 million set out
for triage in the Budget last week will enable

237
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,890
hospitals such as mine to address this issue
and improve patient outcomes?

238
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,260
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is right to recognise, and

239
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,609
we should all recognise, the hard work and
dedication of our excellent staff throughout

240
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:07,950
the NHS. What we are seeing in the NHS is
that A and Es are treating more people than

241
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,880
ever before. We are spending half a trillion
pounds on the NHS in England during this Parliament,

242
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,499
and the NHS is going to see an increase in
its funding of £10 billion in real terms,

243
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:24,510
but there is sometimes an issue, as my hon.
Friend says, about the configuration of A

244
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,769
and E and enabling changes to take place to
help the flow, and to help in dealing with

245
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,820
potential patients as they come in. That is
why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced

246
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,609
last week £425 million in new capital investment
in the NHS, which includes £100 million to

247
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:46,710
help manage the demand on A&amp;E services,
enabling hospitals to make changes to ensure

248
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,749
people are treated in the most appropriate
way possible.

249
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:54,749
>> Nick Thomas-Symonds (Torfaen) (Lab):
Over 200 staff at the Cwmbran pension centre

250
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,869
in my constituency face an uncertain future,
as they have been told they have to relocate

251
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:04,200
to other areas over the next few years. Does
the Prime Minister realise the impact this

252
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,659
has on staff and the local economy, and will
she meet me and representatives of the workforce

253
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,839
to see what can be done to save Cwmbran pension
centre?

254
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,599
>> The Prime Minister:
I recognise the concern that the hon. Gentleman

255
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:22,879
has raised for staff at that particular pension
office in—

256
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,709
>> Nick Thomas-Symonds:
Cwmbran.

257
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:28,990
>> The Prime Minister:
Cwmbran. I recognise this is an issue. I am

258
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,580
sure it is an issue that the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions will look at very

259
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,129
closely, but of course the Government are
looking to ensure that we both use our resources

260
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:43,239
effectively, but also provide the proper and
appropriate service for the recipients of

261
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,399
those particular benefits.

262
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,190
>> Victoria Atkins (Louth and Horncastle)
(Con):

263
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,559
Last weekend, thousands of people from across
Lincolnshire came to the Revesby races in

264
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,519
my constituency to enjoy the racing and the
delicious local food, including award-winning

265
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:07,631
Lincolnshire sausages. As the Government prepare
to strike new international trade deals, will

266
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:13,759
my right hon. Friend ensure that the high
standards we expect of our food producers

267
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,789
and farmers will be met and maintained in
these deals, and will this Government continue

268
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,959
to back British farming?

269
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:26,999
>> The Prime Minister:
I can assure my hon. Friend that we will certainly

270
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:32,419
do that. I remember, when I visited her prior
to the general election in 2015, sampling

271
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:37,500
some of the excellent Lincolnshire sausages
that come from her constituency. We have an

272
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,649
opportunity to build a new future for our
food and farming industry when we leave the

273
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:46,720
European Union. We will maintain the UK’s
high standards of food safety and of animal

274
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,899
welfare; that will be a priority for us. Any
trade deals we enter into will need to be

275
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:56,010
right for consumers, for businesses and for
farmers, and will need to ensure our food

276
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,849
safety and environmental protection, and of
course the animal welfare standards I have

277
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:05,340
just referred to. We recognise the need for
certainty for businesses. We have already

278
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,320
provided guarantees on support for farmers
up to 2020, and I can assure her that we will

279
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,049
continue to back British farmers.

280
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:16,690
>> Callum McCaig (Aberdeen South) (SNP):
The UK has one of the worst performing currencies

281
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:23,570
in the world, and it has a trade deficit of
£133 billion and a national debt approaching

282
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,099
£1.7 trillion. May I ask the Prime Minister:
does she really believe that the UK could

283
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,539
afford to be an independent country?

284
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,940
>> The Prime Minister:
If he wants—[Interruption.]

285
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:44,899
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. There is too much noise in the Chamber.

286
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:49,859
Hon. Members on the SNP Benches are very over-excited
individuals. I want to hear the Prime Minister’s

287
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:50,859
reply. Let us hear the reply.

288
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,269
>> The Prime Minister:
If the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Callum

289
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:59,179
McCaig) wants to talk about figures in relation
to the UK economy, it is the world’s sixth

290
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,720
largest economy, and this Government have
reduced the deficit by two thirds. If he would

291
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,820
care to look at the employment figures we
see today, employment is at a record high

292
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,820
and unemployment has not been lower since
1975.

293
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,749
>> Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham)
(Con):

294
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:28,710
Today is the Ides of March—and, yet again,
Brutus opposite missed badly—so will the

295
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,693
Prime Minister take the opportunity to stick
the knife into the ridiculous Court of Justice

296
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:37,409
of the European Union, which ruled yesterday
that employers can ban their staff from wearing

297
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:42,979
signs of religious or political belief, and
reiterate that reasonable freedom of expression

298
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:46,749
should never be snuffed out by insidious political
correctness?

299
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:51,619
>> The Prime Minister:
We have, as my hon. Friend knows, a strong

300
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:56,110
tradition in this country of freedom of expression.
It is the right of all women to choose how

301
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,719
they dress and we do not intend to legislate
on this issue. He raised the broader issue

302
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:06,529
of symbols, but this case came up particularly
in relation to the wearing of the veil. There

303
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,200
will be times when it is right to ask for
a veil to be removed, such as at border security

304
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,509
or, perhaps, in court. Individual institutions
can make their own policies, but it is not

305
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,889
for Government to tell women what they can
and cannot wear. We want to continue that

306
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,249
strong tradition of freedom of expression.

307
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:25,190
>> Ms Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh (Ochil and South
Perthshire) (SNP):

308
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:40,509
Our First Minister was elected with the largest
vote in Scottish parliamentary history, on

309
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:41,509
a manifesto that stated that the Scottish
Parliament—[Interruption.]

310
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,509
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The question will be heard.

311
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:43,609
>> Ms Ahmed-Sheikh:
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will start again.

312
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:50,539
Our First Minister was elected with the largest
vote in Scottish parliamentary history, on

313
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,429
a manifesto pledge that the Scottish Parliament
should have the right to hold an independence

314
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,429
referendum

315
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:01,960
“if there is a significant and material
change in the circumstances…such as Scotland

316
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,779
being taken out of the EU against our will.”

317
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:09,840
My question to the Prime Minister is simple:
does she agree that Governments should stick

318
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,319
to their manifesto promises? If so, she cannot
object to the First Minister sticking to hers.

319
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:23,020
>> The Prime Minister:
I of course recognise that a vote took place

320
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,720
for the Scottish Parliament, and that the
First Minister was returned as the First Minister

321
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:38,590
of a minority Government, but I refer the
hon. Lady to two other votes that took place.

322
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,309
In September 2014, the Scottish people were
given the opportunity to vote on whether or

323
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,109
not they wished to remain in the United Kingdom.
They chose that Scotland should remain part

324
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:55,330
of the United Kingdom. That was described
by the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex

325
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:03,850
Salmond) as a “once in a generation” vote.
The other vote to take note of was on 23 June

326
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,941
last year, when the people of the United Kingdom
voted to leave the European Union, and that

327
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,549
is what we are going to do.

328
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,700
>> Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (The Cotswolds)
(Con):

329
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:20,110
With 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises
reluctant to export, does my right hon. Friend

330
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,549
agree that the prospect of Brexit gives those
firms—particularly those from Scotland—a

331
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:30,529
golden opportunity to use the great British
entrepreneurial spirit to go out into the

332
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,649
world and succeed?

333
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:40,470
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Small

334
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,789
businesses and entrepreneurs are essential
to an economy that is working for everyone.

335
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:51,379
The opportunity that comes from Brexit is
to see those firms go out and export across

336
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:56,769
the world, and to do those trade deals that
will be of benefit to them, to their communities

337
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,869
and to our economy. We want to encourage more
businesses to go out there and export. That

338
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:06,559
is exactly what my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for International Trade is doing.

339
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,919
This is an important part of building a stronger,
fairer Britain for the future.

340
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,659
>> Hannah Bardell (Livingston) (SNP):
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs employs

341
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,259
more than 1,000 vital staff in my Livingston
constituency. Despite widespread criticism

342
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,029
from the National Audit Office and the Public
Accounts Committee, and despite Livingston

343
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:29,320
having the most engaged and productive staff,
the Prime Minister’s Government are determined

344
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,549
to move jobs from Livingston to Edinburgh.
Staff do not want to move there and rental

345
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:38,570
costs will be higher. To compound that, last
week Ethicon announced that 400 jobs are set

346
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,729
to go at its Livingston site. Will the Prime
Minister therefore change her mind on HMRC

347
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:49,520
jobs in Livingston, and meet me to ensure
that public sector jobs that are vital to

348
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,639
Livingston stay in Livingston?

349
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:57,419
>> The Prime Minister:
HMRC is indeed relocating from 170 outdated

350
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,969
offices to 13 large, modern regional centres.
The new centres will be equipped with the

351
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:07,620
digital infrastructure and facilities that
are needed to build a more highly skilled

352
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,159
and flexible workforce, to enable the modernisation
of ways of working, make tax collection more

353
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:19,259
efficient and effective, and bring significant
improvements to HMRC’s customer services.

354
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:24,809
>> Dr Caroline Johnson (Sleaford and North
Hykeham) (Con):

355
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:31,279
The people of Sleaford and North Hykeham voted
strongly in favour of Brexit, and I was very

356
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,889
proud to be here in the House on Monday to
vote in support of the European Union (Notification

357
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:39,879
of Withdrawal) Bill. Will my right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister confirm that she shares

358
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:49,609
my commitment to a Brexit that works in the
best interests of everyone in our country?

359
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:57,779
>> The Prime Minister:
I have to say—[Interruption.]

360
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,429
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The hon. Member for Perth and North

361
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:13,460
Perthshire (Pete Wishart) was shouting from
beyond the Bar, which is very disorderly.

362
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:24,909
On top of that, a few moments ago he was gesticulating
in a most eccentric manner. I am becoming

363
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:27,959
concerned about the hon. Gentleman, who must
now calm himself.

364
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,950
>> The Prime Minister:
Thank you, Mr Speaker. My hon. Friend the

365
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,759
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Dr
Johnson) is absolutely right. As she says,

366
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,450
her constituency voted overwhelmingly to leave
the European Union. The point is that the

367
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,330
people of the United Kingdom voted by a majority
to leave the European Union. As we do that,

368
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:49,879
we will ensure that the deal we achieve in
our negotiations is the right deal for the

369
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:55,879
whole of the United Kingdom—for people in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

370
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:59,169
>> Yvette Cooper (Normanton, Pontefract and
Castleford) (Lab):

371
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:08,090
The Prime Minister has just made a £2 billion
Budget U-turn in the space of a week. Last

372
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,790
year, the Government made a £4 billion U-turn
in the space of five days. Is that why they

373
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:20,140
want to abolish spring Budgets—because they
just keep ripping them up?

374
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:32,579
>> The Prime Minister:
I welcome the measures in the spring Budget

375
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,859
to improve school places for children, and
to ensure that we put money—[Interruption.]

376
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,620
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. The hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael

377
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:44,010
Fabricant) is another very eccentric fellow
shouting very loudly. You must not shout down

378
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,730
your own Prime Minister! Let us hear the Prime
Minister.

379
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,610
>> The Prime Minister:
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I welcome the measures

380
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:58,490
in the spring Budget to ensure we put money
into schools, skills and social care. I would

381
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,720
have thought the right hon. Member for Normanton,
Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)

382
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,210
would have accepted that putting money into
schools, skills and social care is good for

383
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,470
this country.

384
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:14,980
>> Rebecca Pow (Taunton Deane) (Con):
Will the Prime Minister join me in welcoming

385
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,870
the news today that Sergeant Blackman’s
murder conviction has been downgraded to manslaughter,

386
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:26,130
in part thanks to the release of previously
unheard evidence? That is fantastic news for

387
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:33,621
his wife Claire, who lives in my constituency
and who has campaigned so unstintingly. My

388
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:38,110
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Richard
Drax), who I believe is returning from chambers,

389
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,070
proved a very worthy advocate in this case,
and I commend his hard work. Does the Prime

390
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:48,910
Minister agree that, within the correct legal
framework, those who defend our peace and

391
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,490
protect our world from evil should be treated
with fairness and understanding and given

392
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:59,480
the adequate resources, including mental health
support, that they deserve?

393
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,700
>> The Prime Minister:
Of course we respect the court’s decision.

394
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,800
The Ministry of Defence will be looking very
closely at the judgment. I assure the House

395
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,260
that the Ministry of Defence has co-operated
fully at each stage of Sergeant Blackman’s

396
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,530
case. It will continue to provide support
to the family, as it has done since the charges

397
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,710
were first brought. I would just say, on the
general point, that our Royal Marines have

398
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:26,500
a worldwide reputation as one of the world’s
elite fighting forces. They make an incredible

399
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,090
contribution to our country and we should
pay tribute to them all.

400
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,100
>> Stephen Twigg (Liverpool, West Derby) (Lab/Co-op):
The Disasters Emergency Committee has launched

401
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,620
its east Africa crisis appeal. In the context
of that crisis, does the Prime Minister share

402
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:46,520
my concern that President Trump is considering
major cuts to spending by the US on aid? Will

403
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:52,250
the Government take every opportunity to press
the Americans to remain fully part of the

404
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,550
global humanitarian system?

405
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,070
>> The Prime Minister:
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we recognise

406
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,990
the severity and urgency of the crisis taking
place in east Africa. More than 20 million

407
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,040
people face the risk of dying from starvation
because of war and drought. Again, it is this

408
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,240
country that is leading the way in delivering
life-saving support. We have announced that

409
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,210
we will match, pound for pound, the first
£5 million donated by the public to the Disasters

410
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,510
Emergency Committee’s new east Africa crisis
appeal, to which he referred. I assure him

411
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:29,880
that we take every opportunity to ensure that
countries around the world recognise the importance

412
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:37,581
of international aid, and of supporting countries
when we see terrible disasters such as this

413
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:44,570
famine coming into being. The UK’s record,
and what we do, enable us to say to others

414
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,200
that they should do more.

415
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,590
>> Henry Smith (Crawley) (Con):
It is my honour to chair the all-party parliamentary

416
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:57,580
group on blood cancer. Today we launched an
inquiry into greater awareness of the condition

417
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,720
and the patient experience. I seek assurances
from my right hon. Friend that the additional

418
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,800
£10 billion going into the NHS in this Parliament
will in some way be spent on ensuring that

419
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,300
we tackle this third-biggest cancer killer.

420
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,710
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is right to raise this subject.

421
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,651
Many people have not heard much about this
particular cancer, and are probably not much

422
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:27,560
aware of it as an issue. I can assure him
about what the NHS is doing. Over the last

423
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,070
few years, we have seen a significant improvement
in cancer survival rates. We have seen an

424
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,970
increase in the number of people being referred
on because of potential cancer cases, and

425
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,770
an increase in the number of people being
treated for cancer. This is a record on which

426
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,750
we want to build.
