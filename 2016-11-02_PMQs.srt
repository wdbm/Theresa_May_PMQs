1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:08,580
>>Stephen Doughty: If she will list her official
engagements for Wednesday 2 November

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,250
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,039
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,449
later today.
>>Stephen Doughty: We have no clarity on access

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:27,869
to the single market, huge disadvantages still
in energy costs and foreign steel being used

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,500
in our key defence projects. We know that
the Prime Minister likes to try to channel

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,600
the Iron Lady, but when will she show some
mettle in standing up for British-made steel?

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,130
>>The Prime Minister: This Government have
stood up for British-made steel, and we have

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,170
taken a number of measures that have improved
the situation for the steel industry. The

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,750
hon. Gentleman says that there is no clarity
in relation to Brexit. I am very clear that

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,470
what we want to achieve is the best possible
deal for businesses in the United Kingdom,

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,940
so that they can trade with, and operate within,
the single European market.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:09,830
>>Rehman Chishti: I applaud the Government's
continued commitment to infrastructure development,

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,690
with 6,000 projects in the pipeline worth
£480 billion. Will the Government quickly

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,120
and speedily take forward the lower Thames
crossing and extra investment in Kent roads,

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,590
which will help to provide more homes, jobs
and businesses, and help people in Kent, Medway

17
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,380
and the Thames Gateway area? 
>>The Prime Minister: I am grateful to my

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,659
hon. Friend for his question and for recognising
the contribution that the Government have

19
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,701
made in increasing investment in infrastructure
and the importance of that investment. We

20
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:43,010
have consulted on proposals around a lower
Thames crossing. There were more than 47,000

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,630
responses to that consultation. Those are
now being considered, and my right hon. Friend

22
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:52,840
the Secretary of State for Transport will
respond to that consultation in due course.

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:04,840
>>Jeremy Corbyn: May I take this opportunity
to welcome Neasa Constance McGinn? I hope

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,340
that the evidently effective crash course
in midwifery undertaken by my hon. Friend

25
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,730
the Member for St Helens North (Conor McGinn)
is not a sign to the Government that we believe

26
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:35,260
in downgrading midwifery training. Just a
few months ago, on

27
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,540
the steps of Downing Street, the Prime Minister
promised to stand up for families who are

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:48,980
just managing to get by. However, we
now know that those were empty words, as this

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,770
Government plan to cut work allowances for
exactly those families who are just getting

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,540
by. Is it not the case that her cuts to universal
credit will leave millions worse off?

31
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,870
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I congratulate
the right hon. Gentleman on the birth, I understand,

32
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:25,670
of his granddaughter? [Interruption.] No?
I am sorry. In that case, I am completely

33
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:42,660
mystified. [Interruption.] In that case[Interruption.]
Wait for it. In that case, perhaps one should

34
00:03:42,660 --> 00:04:10,599
never trust a former Chief Whip. [Interruption.]
On the point that the right hon. Gentleman

35
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,640
raised in relation to universal credit, the
introduction of universal credit was an important

36
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,329
reform that was brought about in our welfare
system. It is a simpler system, so people

37
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,880
can see much more easily where they stand
in relation to benefits. Crucially, the point

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:33,530
about universal credit is making sure that
work always pays. As people work more, they

39
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,870
earn more. It is right that we do not want
to see people just being written off to a

40
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,860
life on benefits and that we are encouraging
people to get into the workplace.

41
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,380
>>Jeremy Corbyn: It is a bit unfair to blame
a former Chief Whip for some little bit of

42
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,500
confusion very ungallant. Can we not just
admire my hon. Friend the Member for St Helens

43
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:13,760
North for his work? [Interruption.] It is
extremely rude to point. The Prime Minister's

44
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,720
predecessor abandoned those same cuts to working
people through the tax credit system. Now

45
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,690
the right hon. Lady as Prime Minister is enacting
them through universal credit. The Centre

46
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,910
for Social Justice says that these cuts will
leave 3 million families £1,000 per year

47
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,790
worse off. Why is the Prime Minister slipping
the same cuts in through the back door?

48
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:52,720
>>The Prime Minister: At least my former Chief
Whip has a job. On the serious point that

49
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,931
the right hon. Gentleman raises about universal
credit, I repeat what I have just said. I

50
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:01,400
think it is important that we look at why
universal credit has been introduced. It was

51
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,050
introduced because, under the benefits system
under the Labour Government, we saw too many

52
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,460
people finding that they were better off on
benefits than they were in work. What is important

53
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,750
is that we value work and we value getting
people into work if they are able to work,

54
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:28,490
but we want a system that is fair both to
those who need the benefits and to those who

55
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:35,509
pay for the benefits through their taxes.
There are many families struggling to make

56
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,440
ends meet who are paying for the benefits
of others. I want a system that is fair to

57
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,139
them as well.
>>Jeremy Corbyn: This week, an Oxford University

58
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,509
study found that there is a direct link between
rising levels of benefit sanctions and rising

59
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:58,259
demand for food banks. A million people accessed
a food bank last year to receive a food parcel;

60
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:04,580
only 40,000 did so in 2010. I welcome the
Government's promise to review the work

61
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,020
capability assessment for disabled people,
but will the Prime Minister further commit

62
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,830
to reviewing the whole punitive sanctions
regime?

63
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:20,870
>>The Prime Minister: It is absolutely right
that in our welfare system, we have a system

64
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:27,100
that makes sure that those people who receive
benefits are those for whom it is right to

65
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,550
receive benefits. That is why we have assessments
in our welfare system. But it is also important

66
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,880
in our welfare system that we ensure that
those who are able to get into the workplace

67
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,169
are making every effort to get into the workplace.
That is why we have sanctions in our system.

68
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,009
What the right hon. Gentleman wants is no
assessments, no sanctions and unlimited welfare.

69
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:55,800
That is not fair to those who are accessing
the welfare system, and it is not fair to

70
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,940
the taxpayers who pay for it.
>>Jeremy Corbyn: According to a Sheffield

71
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:08,419
Hallam University study, one in five claimants
who have been sanctioned became homeless as

72
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:15,509
a result. Many of those included families
with children. Could I recommend the Prime

73
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:21,320
Minister supports British cinema, and takes
herself along to a cinema to see a Palme d'Or-winning

74
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,660
film, I, Daniel Blake? While she is
doing so, perhaps she could take the Work

75
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,079
and Pensions Secretary with her, because he
described the film as monstrously unfair

76
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:37,128
and then went on to admit that he had never
seen it, so he has obviously got a very fair

77
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:42,029
sense of judgment on this. But I will tell
the Prime Minister what is monstrously unfair:

78
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:47,749
ex-servicemen like David Clapson dying without
food in his home due to the Government�s

79
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:53,819
sanctions regime. It is time that we ended
this institutionalised barbarity against often

80
00:08:53,819 --> 00:09:00,339
very vulnerable people.
>>The Prime Minister: I have to say to the

81
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,529
right hon. Gentleman that, of course, it is
important that, in our welfare system, we

82
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,040
ensure that those who need the support that
the state is giving them through the benefits

83
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,259
system are able to access that. But it is
also important in our system that those who

84
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:21,220
are paying for it feel that the system is
fair to them as well. That is right; that

85
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,079
is why we need to have work capability assessments it
is why we need to have sanctions in our system.

86
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:33,029
Now, the right hon. Gentleman has a view that
there should be no assessments, no sanctions

87
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:39,199
and unlimited welfare. I have to say to him
that the Labour party is drifting away from

88
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:45,929
the views of Labour voters; it is the Conservative
party that understands working-class people.

89
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:52,389
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The housing benefit bill
has gone up by more than £4 billion because

90
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,110
of high levels of rent and the necessity of
supporting people with that. Is that a sensible

91
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:05,529
use of public money? I think not. In response
to the March Budget, I asked the Chancellor

92
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:15,709
to abandon the £30 cut for disabled people
on employment and support allowance, who are

93
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:21,339
unable to work, but who, with support, may
be able to work in the future they want

94
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,059
to be able to get into work. What evidence
does the Prime Minister have that imposing

95
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,089
poverty on people with disabilities actually
helps them into work?

96
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,610
>>The Prime Minister: I am pleased to say
that what we have seen under this Government

97
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,369
is nearly half a million more disabled people
actually in the workplace. My right hon. Friend

98
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:44,839
the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
has launched a Green Paper on work, which

99
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,739
is starting to look at how we can continue
to provide and increase support for those

100
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:52,899
who are disabled who want to get into the
workplace. But the right hon. Gentleman started

101
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,549
his question by asking me about the increase
in the money that is being spent on housing

102
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:03,110
benefit. If he thinks that the amount of money
being spent on housing benefit is so important,

103
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,670
why did he oppose the changes we made to housing
benefit to reduce the housing benefit bill?

104
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:16,499
>>Jeremy Corbyn: As the Prime Minister well
knows, my concern, and that of my party, is

105
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:21,059
about the incredible amount of money being
paid into the private rented sector in excessive

106
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:28,929
rents, and that could be brought under control
and handled much better. Many people in this

107
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:34,519
House will have been deeply moved by the article
by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea East

108
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,459
(Carolyn Harris) about the tragic death of
her son and having to take out a bank loan

109
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,959
to cover the funeral costs. The Prime Minister
may be aware that the Sunday Mirror, with

110
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,040
the support of the Labour party, is calling
for an end to council charges for the cost

111
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,490
to parents of laying a child to rest. It would
cost £10 million a year a very small proportion

112
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,839
of total Government expenditure to ensure
that every council could ensure that those

113
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,639
going through the horror of laying a child
to rest did not have a bill imposed on them

114
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,149
by the local authority to put that child to
rest. I hope the Prime Minister will be able

115
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,379
to consider this and act accordingly.
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the issue

116
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:18,549
that the right hon. Gentleman has raised.
There are, of course, facilities available

117
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,360
through the social fund funeral expenses payment
scheme for payments to be made available to

118
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
people who qualify and meet the eligibility
conditions. Of course it is difficult for

119
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,459
anybody when they have to go through the tragedy
of losing a child and then face consequences

120
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,160
of the sort that the right hon. Gentleman
mentions. We are making sure, of course, in

121
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,389
relation to local authorities, that they now
have the extra revenues available to them

122
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,989
through business rates and other local revenues.
It is up to councils to consider what they

123
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:54,600
wish to do on this, but I say to the right
hon. Gentleman that there are facilities available

124
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,970
through those social fund funeral expenses
to deal with the issue that he raises.

125
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,990
>>David Mackintosh: Northamptonshire has for
a long time had a growing population without

126
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,660
the right level of funding for our public
services. Can my right hon. Friend assure

127
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,129
me that the current reviews of the funding
formulas for schools, policing and health

128
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,609
will properly reflect the population growths
in Northampton and the rest of the county

129
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:26,139
so that our services get the funding they
need?

130
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,569
>>The Prime Minister: We have protected the
schools budget in relation to funding paid

131
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:37,100
per pupil, and we are protecting the police
budget. But of course, as we look at the various

132
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,380
ways the various funding formulas through
which we are funding public services in my

133
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,559
hon. Friend's constituency and in the county
of Northamptonshire, we will be looking at

134
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,279
the very issue of what is right in terms of
the needs of the local area and the numbers

135
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,680
of people there.
>>Angus Robertson: It is with sadness that

136
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,769
we learned of the death of a serviceman in
a live firing exercise at the range in Tain.

137
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,671
No doubt the Prime Minister and right hon.
and hon. Members across this House will extend

138
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:08,980
their condolences to the family, friends and
colleagues of the serviceman who has died

139
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,889
so tragically. The Prime Minister says that
she wants to tackle international and domestic

140
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:22,290
tax avoidance and serious criminality. SNP
Members support this. If she were told that

141
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:29,320
specific UK financial vehicles were being
used for tax avoidance and other serious criminality,

142
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,239
what would she do about it?
>>The Prime Minister: First, I am sure that,

143
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,249
as the right hon. Gentleman says, the whole
House would wish to pass on our condolences

144
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:44,160
to the friends and family of the serviceman
who has died at the Tain range. The right

145
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,069
hon. Gentleman mentions tax avoidance. Yes
indeed, we have done a significant amount

146
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:53,239
in relation to tax avoidance. He asks what
anybody should do if they have evidence of

147
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:57,629
people actually avoiding tax. I suggest that
he speaks to HMRC.

148
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:04,429
>>Angus Robertson: Scottish limited partnerships
were established by this House in 1907, and

149
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:10,670
they are being aggressively marketed internationally,
especially in eastern Europe. The International

150
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,470
Monetary Fund has warned of the risk posed
by SLPs in the fight against global money

151
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:21,610
laundering and against organised crime. It
is now a matter of public record that SLPs

152
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,970
have acted as fronts for websites peddling
child abuse images, and have been part of

153
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:35,939
major corruption cases in Ukraine, Uzbekistan,
Latvia and Moldova, including in the arms

154
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:41,230
industry. Given the seriousness of this issue
and the Prime Minister's commitment to deal

155
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:48,749
with criminality, but the lack of progress
on SLPs, will she agree to meet me to discuss

156
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:53,499
a joint way forward?
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman

157
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:58,579
raises issues around criminality and investigations
into criminal activity that is taking place,

158
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:04,639
and talks about the issue of websites peddling
child abuse and child sexual exploitation.

159
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,329
It is precisely in order to increase our ability
to deal with this criminal activity that we

160
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:14,751
created the National Crime Agency and have
been ensuring that we are working with the

161
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:20,819
City on other issues such as money laundering.
We are looking at the whole question of how

162
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:26,389
we can ensure that we are taking effective
action on criminal activity. I am pleased

163
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,609
to say to the right hon. Gentleman[Interruption.]
He keeps asking me to meet him. As he knows,

164
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:37,279
I do meet him on occasion I am always happy
to do so but if he wants to talk to me about

165
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,370
dealing with criminal activity, then I will
be able to tell him about the work that has

166
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,249
been done over the past six years under this
Government in terms of the National Crime

167
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:50,649
Agency, working with the City on money laundering,
and enhancing our ability to deal with exactly

168
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,009
the sort of criminal activity he is talking
about.

169
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,989
>>Mark Pawsey: Does the Prime Minister agree
that it is disappointing that we did not hear

170
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:03,970
from the Leader of the Opposition any welcome
for the huge boost to manufacturing and employment

171
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,850
that has come from Nissan's decision to
produce two new models at its factory? Does

172
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,888
she agree that that decision demonstrates
great confidence in the UK, with benefits

173
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:17,678
throughout the supply chain, which includes
companies such as Automotive Insulations in

174
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,399
my constituency? 
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is right

175
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:28,960
in two senses. First, it is extremely disappointing
that the Leader of the Opposition has not

176
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,210
welcomed this, unlike his colleague, the hon.
Member for Washington and Sunderland West

177
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,419
(Mrs Hodgson), who has welcomed the fact that
these jobs have been saved in her constituency

178
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:48,669
and in the supply chain around the country that
supply chain is every bit as important. I

179
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,070
know that Automotive Insulations in my hon.
Friend's constituency is receiving money

180
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,910
as part of a project funded through the Advanced
Propulsion Centre, and I wish it all the very

181
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,020
best for the future.
>>David Simpson: What assurances can the Prime

182
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,960
Minister give to the agri-food sector right
across the United Kingdom that it will be

183
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,490
given the important status required in Brexit
negotiations?

184
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:22,530
>>The Prime Minister: I can absolutely assure
the hon. Gentleman that we are determined

185
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,110
to get the best possible deal for the British
people on exiting the European Union. We are

186
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,460
looking at the various sectors and we are
very conscious of the importance of the food

187
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,509
and agricultural sector across the United
Kingdom, particularly in Northern Ireland.

188
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:44,590
We will do everything we can, including listening
to representations made by the Northern Ireland

189
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,370
Executive, to ensure that we get the best
deal possible for our agri-food sector.

190
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,970
>>Ben Howlett: Last week's announcement
on the report on accelerated access to medicines

191
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,070
will have a positive impact on the lives of
children and adults with a rare genetic or

192
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,370
undiagnosed condition. For decades, patients
have struggled to get access to medicines

193
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,500
in a timely fashion, and the work of my hon.
Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk (George

194
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,860
Freeman) made massive progress. Will the Prime
Minister confirm that if the programme is

195
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,820
successful with the first five to 10 drugs
in the first year, it will be extended to

196
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,759
further drugs in following years? [906969]
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is right

197
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:27,179
to welcome the accelerated access review and
to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member

198
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,200
for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman), who has
done so much to place life sciences in the

199
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,779
UK on the agenda and to ensure that the UK
develops as the best possible place to develop

200
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:45,630
new drugs, which is exactly what we want to
see. The Department of Health will look at

201
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,480
the review's recommendations and respond
to them shortly. This is an important development

202
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,429
in our ability to accelerate access to drugs,
which is to the benefit of patients.

203
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,509
>>Callum McCaig: In recent weeks, three Government
Ministers have expressed three different views

204
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:06,270
on what will happen, while industry cries
out for clarity. I am talking not of Brexit,

205
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,759
surprisingly, but of the oil and gas industry.
Will the autumn statement provide additional

206
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,330
support for the industry, or is the Prime
Minister happy to sit back and see thousands

207
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:24,210
more jobs lost? 
>>The Prime Minister: We understand the challenges

208
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:32,309
faced by the UK oil and gas industry and we
take them very seriously. That is why we established

209
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,320
the Oil and Gas Authority and why we have
taken action, with the £2.3 billion package

210
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,740
of measures in the last two Budgets, to make
sure that the North sea continues to attract

211
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,629
investment, and to safeguard the future of
that vital national asset. We have taken a

212
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,779
range of measures. We understand the concerns
about the oil and gas industry, which is why

213
00:20:50,779 --> 00:21:00,330
the Government have already taken action.
>>Kelly Tolhurst: Rochester airport and Medway

214
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,080
city industrial estate in my constituency
are home to a growing number of successful

215
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,320
science and tech SMEs that are doing wonders
for innovation and our economy. Ahead of my

216
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,679
right hon. Friend's trade mission to India,
I congratulate her on her decision to take

217
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,980
with her a cohort of SMEs to help to increase
trading relationships with emerging economies.

218
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,429
Will her delegation continue to ensure that
all parts our economy are able to seize the

219
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,120
opportunities that present themselves as we
leave the EU?

220
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,220
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right about the importance of small and medium-sized

221
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:45,029
businesses, particularly in the technology
industry. That is why I am pleased that I

222
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,870
will take leading small and medium-sized businesses
from the life sciences and technology sectors

223
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,450
with me on my forthcoming trip to India. It
is important to enable them to forge trading

224
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,010
links with India, and I assure my hon. Friend
that, as we look at the arrangements for leaving

225
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,960
the European Union, we will take the interests
of all sectors into account.

226
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:13,510
>>Angela Smith: Tata Speciality is a big employer
in my constituency and its workforce are worried

227
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:20,840
by the long period of uncertainty enacted
by Tata Steel. Will the Prime Minister use

228
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,029
her trade visit to India to secure from the
company the future of steel production in

229
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,630
Britain, and to convey the importance of Tata
acting as a responsible owner and, in the

230
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,450
case of Tata Speciality, seller of its UK
steel assets?

231
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,690
>>The Prime Minister: I can assure the hon.
Lady that we recognise both the importance

232
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,019
of steel and the importance of Tata in the
United Kingdom. That is why, as a Government,

233
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:55,230
we have had discussions with Tata on the future
of steel here in the United Kingdom, and we

234
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:01,389
will continue to do so.
>>David Warburton: As I am sure the Prime

235
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:08,570
Minister is aware, my constituency apparently
contains more cows than any other. That means

236
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,759
world-class cheese, from Godminster and Barber's
to Montgomery's Cheddar, Wkye Farms and

237
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,410
many more. Can my right hon. Friend assure
the west country's farmers that in negotiating

238
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,039
the best deal for Britain in the coming weeks
and months, the interests of our agricultural

239
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,230
industry and farming community will be foremost
in her mind? Will she pop down to Somerset

240
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,730
soon for a chunk of Cheddar and perhaps a
drop of cider?

241
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,629
>>Mr Speaker: West country cheese! I think
we are clear.

242
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:44,429
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friends invitation
for some west country cheese and cider is

243
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,220
difficult to refuse, so I look forward at
some stage to coming down to Somerset and

244
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,679
being able to sample those products. He is
absolutely right, as others in this Chamber

245
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,929
have been, about the importance of our agricultural
sector to economies across the UK. Particular

246
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:07,070
parts of the UK rely heavily on the agricultural
sector, and we will be taking their needs

247
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:12,480
and considerations into account as we negotiate
and deliver the best possible deal for this

248
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,580
country in leaving the EU.
>>Jeff Smith: This morning the High Court

249
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,470
ruled that the Government have comprehensively
failed to tackle air pollution properly. Which

250
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,951
does the Prime Minister feel is worse: the
Government losing in the High Court for the

251
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:34,390
second time, or the 40,000 early deaths that
result from air pollution every year in the

252
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,690
UK? 
>>The Prime Minister: I have been asked about

253
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,460
air quality in this Chamber previously at
Prime Minister's questions, and I have always

254
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,429
made it clear that we recognise that there
is more for the Government to do. We have

255
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:55,100
been doing a lot in this area. We have been
putting extra money into actions that will

256
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,559
relieve the issues around air quality, but
we recognise that the Department for Environment,

257
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,429
Food and Rural Affairs now has to look at
the judgment that has been made by the courts,

258
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:05,600
and we have to look again at the proposals
that we will bring forward. Nobody in this

259
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,419
House doubts the importance of the issue of
air quality. We have taken action, but there

260
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:20,019
is more to do and we will do it.
>>Robert Courts: The Prime Minister will remember

261
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:26,480
visiting the Witney constituency recently.
I am pleased to report that Chipping Norton

262
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,009
has been shortlisted for the Great British
High Street awards. Will she join me in congratulating

263
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:38,190
the small businesses of Chipping Norton, and
can she tell me what support Government offer

264
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:45,260
to the small businesses in our market towns?
>>The Prime Minister: May I take this opportunity,

265
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,710
which is my first opportunity, to welcome
my hon. Friend to this Chamber? I congratulate

266
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:57,399
him on his excellent result in the by-election.
My hon. Friend's question brings back many

267
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:01,870
happy memories for me, because when I was
a child Chipping Norton was our local town.

268
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:08,600
I used to go there and spend my pocket money
assiduously in the shops, so I have done my

269
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,150
bit for his high street in Chipping Norton.
We are very clear, as a Government, that the

270
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,200
action we have taken on issues such as business
rates is there to help to support small businesses.

271
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,970
>>Mr Speaker: We are always grateful for a
bit of extra information, and we have now

272
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,780
had it.
>>Gavin Newlands: This Government's record

273
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,160
on immigration detention is disgraceful, with
the UK being the only country in the EU that

274
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,090
has no time limit on detention. Amid concern
over plans to replace Dungavel with a short-term

275
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,769
detention facility near Glasgow airport, the
people of Renfrewshire want no part in these

276
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:45,220
inhumane and ineffective practices. Will she
use the closure of Dungavel as an opportunity

277
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,950
to rethink detention policy and end this stain
on our human rights record? [906971]

278
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,169
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman will
know that a lot of work has been done by the

279
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:58,370
Government on the whole question of immigration
detention, and a number of changes have been

280
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:05,059
made. An independent review took place about
a year ago on the whole question of detention

281
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:13,519
of people in the immigration estate. It is
important to realise that where people are

282
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:20,159
due to be removed from this country and there
is the prospect that they could be lost to

283
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,039
the system if they are not detained, there
are circumstances in which it is right to

284
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:29,080
detain them in the immigration estate. We
need to make sure we have got that estate

285
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,249
right, and that is why a lot of work has been
done on this. The fundamental point is that

286
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:38,370
I suspect he does not think we should detain
anybody in relation to immigration enforcement,

287
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,820
but we believe there are those who are rightly
detained before we remove them from this country.

288
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:53,289
>>Mr Charles Walker: When people make fun
of Christianity in this country, it rightly

289
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:58,289
turns the other cheek. When a young gymnast,
Louis Smith, makes fun of another religion

290
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:04,249
widely practised in this country, he is hounded
on Twitter and by the media and suspended

291
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:10,380
by his association. For goodness sake,
this man received death threats, and we have

292
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,470
all looked the other way. My question to the
Prime Minister is this: what is going on in

293
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,269
this country, because I no longer understand
the rules?

294
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:27,220
>>The Prime Minister: I understand the level
of concern that my hon. Friend has raised

295
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,259
in relation to this matter. There is a balance
that we need to find. We value freedom of

296
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:39,830
expression and freedom of speech in this country that
is absolutely essential in underpinning our

297
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:47,280
democracy but we also value tolerance of
others and tolerance in relation to religions.

298
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,090
This is one of the issues we have looked at
in the counter-extremism strategy that the

299
00:28:52,090 --> 00:29:00,139
Government have produced. Yes, it is right
that people can have that freedom of expression,

300
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:06,520
but that right has a responsibility too, which
is the responsibility to recognise the importance

301
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,700
of tolerance of others.
>>Chris Stephens: Today's Daily Record leads

302
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,860
on DWP issues. Is the Prime Minister aware
that a telephone call to the Department for

303
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,740
Work and Pensions by a severely disabled person
or their carer can cost up to 45p a minute,

304
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,919
which, with an average length of a call of
13 minutes, is a considerable sum from their

305
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,200
social security entitlement? Should a disabled
citizen pay this price, or does the Prime

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,230
Minister agree with me that we should end
this telephone tax on the most vulnerable

307
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,029
in our society?
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises

308
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,850
an issue that has been raised on a number
of occasions in this House. That is why the

309
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,809
Government are implementing new guidelines
in relation to the operation of these telephone

310
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:56,149
lines. The number of lines that are costing
people in the way to which he refers is being

311
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,130
reduced, so the Government have recognised
the issue and are taking action.

312
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,070
>>Maria Caulfield: The past 18 months have
been hell for commuters in my constituency

313
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,369
of Lewes using the Southern rail network.
Last night, a journey that should have taken

314
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:15,429
just over an hour took over four hours. May
I beg the Prime Minister to intervene on the

315
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,809
Southern rail network? While we have a country
that works for everyone, in Sussex we have

316
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:26,580
a railway that works for no one.
>>The Prime Minister: I feel for my hon. Friend

317
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,289
in relation to the journey she had to go through
last night and the extended time that it took.

318
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,090
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
for Transport has been taking action in working

319
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,881
with Southern rail and Network Rail in relation
to the improvements that are necessary. We

320
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:46,390
have stepped in to invest £20 million specifically
to tackle the breakdown on the Southern rail

321
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:52,210
network, which is proving so difficult for
passengers. I recognise the degree of concern

322
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,769
about this. My right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Transport is on the case, and

323
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:04,739
is working to ensure those improvements.
>>Steve McCabe: Has the Prime Minister spotted

324
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:12,239
the ludicrous refusal by FIFA, the footballing
federation, to let our players wear poppies

325
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:17,179
at the forthcoming Scotland-England game?
Will she tell the respective associations

326
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:24,739
that, in this country, we decide when to wear
poppies and that we will be wearing them at

327
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:28,570
Wembley?
>>The Prime Minister: I think the stance that

328
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:36,220
has been taken by FIFA is utterly outrageous.
Our football players want to recognise and

329
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,120
respect those who have given their lives for
our safety and security. I think it is absolutely

330
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,299
right that they should be able to do so. This
is for our football associations, but I think

331
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:52,610
a clear message is going from this House that
we want our players to be able to wear poppies.

332
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,419
I have to say to FIFA that before they start
telling us what to do they jolly well ought

333
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:09,489
to sort their own house out.
>>Mr Julian Brazier: May I congratulate my

334
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:17,080
right hon. Friend on her recent announcement
of a taskforce to stamp out the vile business

335
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,799
of modern slavery? Will she join me in congratulating
my constituent Mike Emberson and the Medaille

336
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,770
Trust on their 10 years of work with the victims
and the 70 places they now provide across

337
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,610
their homes for these most unfortunate women?
>>The Prime Minister: I am very pleased to

338
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:41,239
endorse my hon. Friend's comments. I have
met representatives of the Medaille Trust

339
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:46,989
and talked to some of the victims they have
helped. It is absolutely right that we continue

340
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:51,639
the momentum in our fight against modern slavery.
This country is leading the world and we should

341
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:56,860
continue the fight because, sadly, too much
slavery is still taking place on the streets

342
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,320
and in the towns and villages of this country.
That is why the taskforce I have set up will

343
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,210
continue that momentum. We will be relentless
in our pursuit of eradicating modern slavery.

344
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,159
>>Gordon Marsden: In July, the armed forces
charity SSAFA published an in-depth survey

345
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,059
of nearly 1,000 working-age veterans. Some
85% of them thought the UK did not give them

346
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:29,610
enough support and only 16% thought the armed
forces covenant was being implemented effectively.

347
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,909
What is the Prime Minister doing personally
to change that?

348
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:40,419
>>The Prime Minister: We absolutely recognise
the debt we owe to our veterans. That is why,

349
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:45,419
through the armed forces covenant and throughout
the work the Ministry of Defence is doing,

350
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,139
we increasingly recognise the support that
is necessary for veterans. The hon. Gentleman

351
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:54,049
talks about what we can do. One thing we can
do is to help people who come out of the armed

352
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:58,789
forces to find their way into the world of
work. That is why it is important both that

353
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,960
we have a system that helps them to find the
support that is necessary to get into the

354
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,989
world of work and that we have an economy
that is providing the jobs that people need.

355
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:14,899
>>Martin Vickers: This week is Offshore Wind
Week. The development of the offshore wind

356
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,270
sector is vital to my Cleethorpes constituency.
Will my right hon. Friend assure the industry

357
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,849
and my constituents that the Government will
continue to work with the industry to develop

358
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:29,470
future jobs for young people, with a particular
emphasis on training?

359
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:35,088
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to reassure
my hon. Friend that the Government will continue

360
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:39,490
to work with the industry. It has been an
important development for the United Kingdom

361
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:46,529
and makes up an important part of the energy
we generate from renewables. As he says, it

362
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,639
does provide jobs and we need to ensure that
we look at the training that will enable people

363
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,260
to take up those jobs. That is why skills
form part of the work we are doing on our

364
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,230
future industrial strategy.
>>Mr Nigel Dodds: Does the Prime Minister

365
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,930
agree that it is highly irresponsible and,
indeed, dangerous for people to talk up the

366
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:12,260
prospect of increased violence in Northern
Ireland as a result of our leaving the EU,

367
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,079
and that people should use the agreed institutions
that were set up under the various agreements,

368
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,420
not stand outside them or create new ones?
Does she also agree that Brexit will not result

369
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,290
in any change, alteration or impeding of the
way in which the regions, countries and people

370
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,630
within the UK connect with one another?
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to give

371
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,270
the right hon. Gentleman that assurance in
relation to movement around the United Kingdom.

372
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:48,109
No change will take place. We will ensure
that Brexit is a good deal for the whole of

373
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:53,579
the United Kingdom. Those who wish to encourage
violence off the back of that should, frankly,

374
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:59,190
be ashamed of themselves. It is essential
that we all work together to make a success

375
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,859
of this and get the best possible opportunities
for people across the whole of the United

376
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:08,220
Kingdom.
>>John Howell: Will the Prime Minister join

377
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:14,040
me in praising Henley-on-Thames for receiving
its first tranche of community infrastructure

378
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,630
levy money at the higher rate because it has
a neighbourhood plan? Will she join me in

379
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,560
praising neighbourhood planning generally
as the best means of giving communities a

380
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,010
say over the planning system?
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to congratulate

381
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:35,540
my neighbouring MP and Henley-on-Thames on
that achievement. My hon. Friend is absolutely

382
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,680
right that neighbourhood plans are a crucial
part of the planning system. That is how local

383
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,559
people can have a real say over what is happening
in their local area.

384
00:36:45,559 --> 00:37:01,840
>>Dame Rosie Winterton: May I add my congratulations
to my hon. Friend the Member for St Helens

385
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,160
North (Conor McGinn)? Moving swiftly from
midwives to doctors, is the Prime Minister

386
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:14,249
aware that doctors in Doncaster face a crisis
in primary care, because as GPs retire, it

387
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:20,260
is proving almost impossible to get new ones
to take over their practices? Because of restrictions

388
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:26,030
in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NHS
bodies cannot take the necessary action, for

389
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:32,380
example putting in salaried GPs. Will she
do something about this matter quickly? Otherwise,

390
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:38,960
many of my constituents will be left without
a doctor.

391
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,160
>>The Prime Minister: After my unfortunate
mistake earlier about the right hon. Member

392
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,589
for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), I failed
to add my congratulations to the hon. Member

393
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:58,890
for St Helens North (Conor McGinn), so am
happy now to do so.

394
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:07,000
It is important to have GPs coming through,
so that we can replace those who are retiring.

395
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,970
Over the past six years we have seen thousands
more GPs in our NHS. That is why the Under-Secretary

396
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,041
of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member
for Warrington South (David Mowat), and my

397
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,099
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Health are ensuring that we have a programme

398
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:22,670
to bring more doctors into training, so that
places such as the right hon. Lady's constituency,

399
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:29,950
and those of other Members across the House,
have GPs in the numbers needed.
