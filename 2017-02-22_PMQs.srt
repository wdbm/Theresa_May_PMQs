1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,240
>>Yasmin Qureshi (Bolton South East) (Lab):
If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,770
for Wednesday 22 February.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:13,969
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,859
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House, I shall have further such meetings

5
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,019
later today.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:27,130
>>Yasmin Qureshi: Yesterday, the campaign
group fighting cuts at West Cumberland hospital

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,780
was due to deliver a 30,000-strong petition
to Downing Street. Despite having a slot booked,

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,260
they were turned away at the gates and told,
“Today isn’t a good day. Come back after

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,149
Thursday.” How can the Prime Minister justify
this disgraceful dismissal of the people of

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,350
Copeland?

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,109
>>The Prime Minister: A petition was indeed
delivered to No. 10. The petition was accepted

12
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,760
by No. 10 Downing Street yesterday, so I suggest
to the hon. Lady that she considers what she

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,500
said in her question. I am aware of the issues
that have been raised around West Cumberland

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,909
hospital. I am aware of them because the very
good Conservative candidate in Copeland, Trudy

15
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:22,240
Harrison, has raised them with me. She has
made it very clear that she wants to see no

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
downgrading of services at West Cumberland
hospital. She has made that clear to me and

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,280
to Health Ministers.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,329
>>Andrew Bingham (High Peak) (Con): I recently
met many of my local headteachers in the High

19
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,180
Peak, and they are concerned about the new
national funding formula. Can my right hon.

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,840
Friend assure me that when we decide on the
funding for our schools, we will look at unavoidable

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,810
costs, such as the national apprenticeship
levy, to ensure that our schools have the

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,789
money that they need to educate our children?

23
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:56,469
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising this. The question of schools

24
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,030
funding, and the system we have for schools
funding, is important. I think the current

25
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,189
system is unfair. It is not transparent and
it is out of date. That has been the general

26
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,540
view for some time now. The problem is that
it cannot support the aspiration of all our

27
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:16,170
children to get a great education. We do,
indeed, want children to be able to get the

28
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,660
education that they deserve and that ensures
that they can go as far as their talents and

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,950
hard work take them. The Labour Government
did nothing to address the funding system.

30
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:39,300
We are looking at that funding system. It
is a consultation, and I am sure that the

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,930
comments and the issue my hon. Friend has
raised will be noted by the Secretary of State

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,100
for Education.

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:57,620
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): When
hospitals are struggling to provide essential

34
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,550
care, why is the Prime Minister’s Government
cutting the number of beds in our national

35
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,620
health service?

36
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,770
>>The Prime Minister: Thanks to the medical
advances, to the use of technology and to

37
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:19,480
the quality of care, what we see on hospital
stays is actually that the average length

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,970
of time for staying in hospital has virtually
halved since the year 2000. Let us look at

39
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:40,700
Labour’s record on this issue. In the last
six years of the last Labour Government, 25,000

40
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:49,270
hospital beds were cut. But we do not even
need to go as far back as that. Let us just

41
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:56,450
look at Labour’s policy before the last
election, because before the last election,

42
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,630
the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham),
a former Labour shadow Health Secretary, said

43
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,080
the following:

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,480
“what I’d cut…are hospital beds”.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,540
Labour policy: cut hospital beds.

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:21,959
>>Jeremy Corbyn: In 2010, there was the highest
ever level of satisfaction with the national

47
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,330
health service, delivered by a Labour Government.
The British Medical Association—[Interruption.]

48
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:38,470
It’s doctors. The British Medical Association
tells us that 15,000 beds have been cut in

49
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,639
the past six years, the equivalent of 24 hospitals,
and as a result, we have longer waiting times

50
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,080
at A&E, record delayed discharges and more
people on waiting lists. The Prime Minister

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,810
claims the NHS is getting the money it needs,
so why is it that one in six A&amp;E units

52
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,310
in England are set for closure or downgrading?

53
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,879
>>The Prime Minister: I will tell the right
hon. Gentleman what is happening and what

54
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,620
has happened since 2010 in A&E: we see 1,500
more emergency care doctors—that includes

55
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,749
600 more A&E consultants—and we have got
2,400 more paramedics. We have more people

56
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:31,069
being seen in accident and emergency every
single week under this Government. He talks

57
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,259
about what the NHS needs: what the NHS needs
is more doctors—we are giving it more doctors;

58
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,110
what it needs is more funding—we are giving
it more funding. What it does not need is

59
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,830
a bankrupt economy, which is exactly what
Labour would give it.

60
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,860
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I asked the Prime Minister
why one in six A&E units are currently set

61
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,270
for closure or downgrading; she did not answer.
One of the problems—she well knows this—is

62
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,540
the £4.6 billion cut to social care, which
has a knock-on effect. Her friend the Tory

63
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,729
chair of the Local Government Association,
Lord Porter, has said that

64
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,159
“extra council tax income will not bring
in anywhere near enough money to alleviate

65
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,999
the growing pressure on social care”.

66
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:35,259
Two weeks ago, we found out about the sweetheart
deal with Tory Surrey. When will the other

67
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:43,319
151 social services departments in England
get the same as the Surrey deal?

68
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,699
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
refers to the questions he asked me about

69
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:57,419
Surrey County Council two weeks ago. Those
claims were utterly destroyed the same afternoon,

70
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:07,659
so rather than asking the same question, he
should stand up and apologise.

71
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:21,211
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Far from my apologising,
it is the Prime Minister who ought to be reading

72
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:29,219
her correspondence and answering the letter
from 62 council leaders representing social

73
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:35,009
service authorities who want to know if they
are going to get the same deal as Surrey.

74
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:40,039
They are grappling with a crisis, which has
left over 1 million people not getting the

75
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,580
social care they need.

76
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,150
We opposed Tory cuts in the NHS which involved
scrapping nurses’ bursaries, because we

77
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,620
feared it would discourage people from entering
training. The Prime Minister’s Government

78
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,330
said that removing funding for nurses’ bursaries
would create an extra 10,000 training places

79
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,900
in this Parliament. Has this target been met?

80
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,650
>>The Prime Minister: There are 10,000 more
training places available for nurses in the

81
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:17,449
NHS. The right hon. Gentleman talks about
the amount of money being spent on the NHS.

82
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:25,900
It is this Conservative Government who are
putting the extra funding into the NHS. I

83
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,270
remind him that we are spending £1.3 billion
more on the NHS this year than Labour planned

84
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,250
to spend if it had won the election.

85
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:45,130
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My questions were about social
services funding to pay for social care—no

86
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:52,470
answer. My questions were about the number
of training places for nurses being brought

87
00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:01,140
in—no answer. In reality, 10,000 fewer places
have been filled because there are fewer applications.

88
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,750
A problem is building up for the future. In
addition, the Royal College of Midwives estimates

89
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,910
that there is a shortage of 3,500 midwives
in England, and the Royal College of Nursing

90
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,910
warns:

91
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,600
“The nursing workforce is in crisis and
if fewer nurses graduate in 2020 it will exacerbate

92
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,430
what is already an unsustainable situation”.

93
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,690
Will the Prime Minister at least commit herself
to reinstating the nurses’ bursary?

94
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,030
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
asked me a question about nursing training

95
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:43,140
places, which I answered. If he does not like
the answer he gets, he cannot just carry on

96
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:50,410
asking the same question if I have answered
it previously. He talks about all these issues

97
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,030
in relation to what is happening in the NHS,
so let us look at what is happening in the

98
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:05,620
NHS: we have 1,800 more midwives in the NHS
since 2010; we have more people being seen

99
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,950
in accident and emergency since 2010; and
we have more operations taking place every

100
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:19,430
week in the NHS. Our NHS staff are working
hard. They are providing quality care for

101
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,350
patients up and down the country. What they
do not need is a Labour party policy that

102
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,580
leads to a bankrupt economy. Labour’s policy
is to spend money on everything, which means

103
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,780
bankrupting the economy and having no money
to spend on anything. That does not help doctors

104
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,260
and nurses, it does not help patients, it
does not help the NHS, and it does not help

105
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,640
ordinary working families up and down this
country.

106
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,840
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Yes, let us look at the national
health service and let us thank all those

107
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,870
who work so hard in our national health service,
but also recognise the pressures they are

108
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:05,680
under. Today, a Marie Curie report finds that
nurses are so overstretched they cannot provide

109
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,940
the high-quality care needed for patients
at the very end of their lives. The lack of

110
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,791
care in the community prevents people from
having the dignity of dying at home. There

111
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:21,640
is a nursing shortage and something should
be done about it, such as reinstating the

112
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
nurses’ bursary.

113
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,190
The Prime Minister’s Government have put
the NHS and social care in a state of emergency.

114
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:40,070
Nine out of 10 NHS trusts are unsafe, 18,000
patients a week are waiting—[Interruption.]

115
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:48,330
Mr Speaker, I repeat the figure: 18,000 patients
a week are waiting on trolleys in hospital

116
00:11:48,330 --> 00:12:01,290
corridors and 1.2 million often very dependent—[Interruption.]
It seems to me that some Members are not concerned

117
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:07,070
about the fact that there are 1.2 million
elderly people who are not getting the care

118
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:14,390
they need. The legacy of her Government will
blight our NHS for decades: fewer hospitals,

119
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:20,190
fewer A&E departments, fewer nurses and fewer
people getting the care they need. We need

120
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,460
a Government who will put the NHS first and
will invest in our NHS.

121
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:37,000
>>The Prime Minister: First, the right hon.
Gentleman should consider correcting the record,

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,940
because 54% of hospital trusts are considered
good or outstanding—quite different from

123
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:53,860
the figure he cited. Secondly, I will take
no lessons on the NHS from the party—[Interruption.]

124
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,190
Oh, the deputy leader of the Labour party
says we should take lessons on the NHS, but

125
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:07,490
I will not take any lessons from the party
that presided over the failure that happened

126
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:19,490
at Mid Staffs hospital. Labour says we should
learn lessons. I will tell the House who should

127
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,570
learn lessons: the Labour party, which still
fails to recognise that if you are going to

128
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,710
fund the NHS—we are putting money in, and
there are more doctors, more operations and

129
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,630
more nurses—you need a strong economy. We
now know, however, that Labour has a different

130
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,290
sort of phrase for its approach to these things.
Remember when it used to talk about “boom

131
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,780
and bust”? Now it is borrow and bankrupt.
[Interruption.]

132
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:58,320
>>Mr Speaker: Order. We must get through Back
Benchers’ questions and the Prime Minister’s

133
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,740
answers to them. I call Mr Michael Tomlinson.

134
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,730
>>Michael Tomlinson (Mid Dorset and North
Poole) (Con): Brendan Cox will meet today

135
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,120
with the Duchess of Cornwall to launch plans
to bring communities together over the weekend

136
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,350
of 17 and 18 June to mark the first anniversary
of our colleague Jo’s death. The aim of

137
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,090
this Great Get Together, as it has been called,
is for more than 10 million people across

138
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,920
the country to come together as communities
and neighbours for events such as street parties,

139
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,010
picnics and even bake offs. Will the Prime
Minister join me in agreeing that such events

140
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:39,520
and moments of national reflection and celebration
in our communities will be a fitting tribute

141
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,840
to Jo and will remind us all that, as she
herself said, we have far more things in common

142
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,740
than things that divide us?

143
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,600
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an extremely important point, and I am very

144
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,230
happy to agree that what is becoming known
as the Great Get Together is a fitting and

145
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,640
important tribute to our late colleague Jo
Cox. I commend her husband, Brendan—I am

146
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,370
sure that everyone across the House would
wish to do so—for the work that he has done.

147
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,000
As my hon. Friend said, it is important to
remember that there is more that brings us

148
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,950
together than divides us, and this is an important
moment of national reflection and celebration

149
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:27,290
of the strength of our communities. As we
face the future together—these are momentous

150
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,760
times for this country—it is important that
we remember that being united makes us strong

151
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,800
and recognise the things that unite us, as
a country and a people, and the bonds we share

152
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,120
together. This is a very fitting tribute to
our late colleague.

153
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,590
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): In recent
days, the Prime Minister has said that it

154
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:56,330
is a key personal commitment to transform
the way domestic violence is tackled. It is

155
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,860
hugely welcome that she has called for ideas
about how the treatment of victims could be

156
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:08,040
improved and more convictions against abusers
secured. Combatting violence against women

157
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,870
and preventing domestic violence is the aim
of the Istanbul convention, which the UK is

158
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:20,050
yet to ratify. Does she agree with Members
on both sides of the House that the convention

159
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,420
should be ratified as a priority?

160
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:29,900
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
raises an important subject. As he says, I

161
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,390
take it particularly seriously—I worked
hard on it as Home Secretary and I continue

162
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,090
to do so as Prime Minister. There were still
an estimated 1.3 million female victims of

163
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,950
domestic abuse in the last year and more than
400,000 victims of sexual violence. He is

164
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,260
right that we signed up to the Istanbul convention,
and we are fully committed to ratifying it,

165
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,127
which was why we supported in principle the
private Member’s Bill of the hon. Member

166
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:55,100
for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) on Second
Reading and in Committee. In many ways, the

167
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,510
measures we have in place actually go further
than the convention, but I am clear that we

168
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,419
need to maintain momentum, which is why I
am setting up a ministerial working group

169
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,220
to look at the legislation and at how we can
provide good support to victims, and to consider

170
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,970
the possibility of a domestic violence Act.

171
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:20,079
>>Angus Robertson: This Friday, the House
will consider a Bill on the Istanbul convention.

172
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,919
We know that Ministers have been working hard
with my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and

173
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,409
Buchan (Dr Whiteford), who has cross-party
support for her Bill. Given the importance

174
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:34,269
of this issue and the Prime Minister’s personal
commitment, which she has outlined again today,

175
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:39,720
will she join me in encouraging Members to
support the Bill and discourage any attempts

176
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,529
to use parliamentary wrecking tactics to stop
it?

177
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,120
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to join the
right hon. Gentleman in that. I know that

178
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,049
the Minister for Vulnerability, my hon. Friend
the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton),

179
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,210
has had a number of constructive discussions
with the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan.

180
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,659
The Government have tabled some mutually agreed
amendments, for which the Government will

181
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:07,190
vote this Friday. I hope that all my hon.
Friends who are present on Friday will support

182
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,009
these measures. This is an important Bill.
The Government have supported it, and I hope

183
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,990
it will be supported on both sides of the
House.

184
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,970
>>William Wragg (Hazel Grove) (Con): Residents
in the village of High Lane in my constituency

185
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,240
are concerned about the 4,000 homes proposed
under the Greater Manchester spatial framework,

186
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,590
which will more than double the size of the
village. What assurances can my right hon.

187
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,750
Friend give to my constituents that the green
belt is safe with this Government?

188
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,320
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to give that
commitment to my hon. Friend. The Government

189
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,370
are very clear that the green belt must be
protected. We are very clear that boundaries

190
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,470
should be altered only when local authorities
have fully examined all other reasonable options.

191
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,710
If they do go down that route, they should
compensate by improving the quality or accessibility

192
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,370
of the remaining green-belt land so that it
can be enjoyed. I know about the particular

193
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,100
issue that my hon. Friend raises, and I believe
that the Greater Manchester spatial framework

194
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,159
led to quite a number of responses. There
was a lot of interest in that consultation,

195
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,539
which closed last month, and I am sure that
all those views will be taken into account.

196
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:21,440
>>Caroline Flint (Don Valley) (Lab): Last
week, the all-party group on children of alcoholics

197
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,090
launched a manifesto for change. Some 2.5
million children are growing up in the home

198
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,100
of a problem drinker—I did, too. These children
are twice as likely as others to have problems

199
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,659
at school, three times more likely to consider
suicide, and four times more likely to become

200
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:44,490
an alcoholic, yet today 138 local authorities
have no plan to support these children. Will

201
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,820
the Prime Minister work with the all-party
group to establish the first ever Government

202
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,169
strategy to tackle this hidden problem that
blights the lives of millions?

203
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:58,750
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Lady
raises an important issue. I know that she

204
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,909
recently spoke very movingly about her own
experience. I am sure that Members on both

205
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:09,070
sides of the House recognise the devastating
impact that addiction can have on individuals

206
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:14,529
and their families, so this is an important
issue for her to raise. It is unacceptable

207
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:19,470
that children bear the brunt of their parents’
condition. The Government are committed to

208
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:25,940
working with MPs, health professionals and
those affected to reduce the harm of addiction

209
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,230
and to get people the support they need. We
shall look carefully at the proposals suggested

210
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,230
by the right hon. Lady.

211
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,580
>>Dr Julian Lewis (New Forest East) (Con):
If she will take steps to introduce legislative

212
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,659
proposals to provide legal protection to former
military personnel who served in Northern

213
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,530
Ireland at least equivalent to that offered
to former republican and loyalist paramilitaries.

214
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,159
>>The Prime Minister: As I have made clear,
I think it is absolutely appalling when people

215
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,730
try to make a business out of dragging our
brave troops through the courts. In the case

216
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,710
of Northern Ireland, 90% of deaths were caused
by terrorists, and it is essential that the

217
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,429
justice system reflects that. It would be
entirely wrong to treat terrorists more favourably

218
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,519
than soldiers or police officers. That is
why, as part of our work to bring forward

219
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,519
the Stormont House agreement Bill, we will
ensure that investigative bodies are under

220
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:12,179
a legal duty to be fair, balanced and proportionate
so that our veterans are not unfairly treated

221
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,190
or disproportionately investigated.

222
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,090
>>Dr Lewis: While I welcome that reply, it
does not go quite as far as I and many other

223
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,740
people would like. There is no prospect of
new credible evidence coming forward against

224
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,019
our veterans of the troubles up to 40 years
after the event, yet people are starting to

225
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,159
use the same techniques in Northern Ireland
against them as were used against veterans

226
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:44,029
of Iraq. Surely the answer has to be a statute
of limitations preventing the prosecution

227
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:51,730
of veterans to do with matters that occurred
prior to the date of the Belfast agreement.

228
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:58,440
>>The Prime Minister: As my right hon. Friend
knows, we are looking at this issue as part

229
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,379
of the Stormont House agreement. What we are
doing is ensuring that the investigative bodies

230
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:07,679
responsible for looking at deaths during the
troubles will operate in a fair, balanced

231
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,880
and proportionate manner. We want cases to
be considered in chronological order, and

232
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,399
we want these protections enshrined in legislation.
We are going to consult fully on these proposals,

233
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:20,580
because we want to make sure that we get this
right.

234
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,200
>>Gerald Jones (Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)
(Lab): When the new local housing allowance

235
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,700
cap for social tenants is introduced in 2019,
it will hit people on low incomes in my constituency

236
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,629
hard. In places such as Maidenhead, the allowance
will often exceed the average rent, but the

237
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:43,960
basic weekly allowance in Merthyr Tydfil is
£67, while the rent charged by Merthyr Valleys

238
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,830
Homes is £76, which is already one of the
lowest social housing rents in Wales. That

239
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,210
will mean that tenants, including many older
people, will be expected to find nearly £500

240
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,789
a year to put towards their rent. Will the
Prime Minister act now? Will she issue clear

241
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:03,740
guidance to exempt older people, at the very
least, from these crude cuts, and also to

242
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,330
ensure that the local housing allowance is
in line with local rents?

243
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:19,090
>>The Prime Minister: Local authorities have
a fund and can exercise discretion. There

244
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,990
will be some variation across the country,
and steps have been taken to ensure that particularly

245
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,559
vulnerable people are not affected in the
way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.

246
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,039
>>Dr Tania Mathias (Twickenham) (Con): The
lack of large-scale vaccine manufacturing

247
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:42,559
has been described as a national security
issue for our country, and it will take many

248
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,409
years to build that up. Will the Prime Minister
look into what more the Government can do

249
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,389
to address this highly critical health and
defence concern?

250
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:57,940
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right to raise the issue in that context.

251
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,350
The Government take it very seriously. The
ability to ensure that we can readily scale

252
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:09,149
up vaccine production in the event of a pandemic
is, as she says, vital to our national security.

253
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:13,460
As I am sure she will understand, the precise
details are necessarily confidential, but

254
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,820
I can assure her that we have provisions in
place to ensure that urgently needed vaccines

255
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,690
are available in the UK at short notice, including
in the event of a pandemic. As an added contingency,

256
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,549
we are funding a £10 million competition
to establish a world-leading centre for vaccine

257
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,679
manufacturing. However, that is only part
of the picture, because we are in a strong

258
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,720
position: we have one of the most comprehensive
and successful vaccination programmes in the

259
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,409
world, backed up by £300 million in this
year alone.

260
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:45,789
>>Kerry McCarthy (Bristol East) (Lab): Last
night Bristol City Council set its budget.

261
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:50,929
Very difficult decisions were made more difficult
by the abject failure of the previous Mayor

262
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,220
to get a grip on the council’s finances.
It has taken a Labour Mayor to face up to

263
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:03,210
the challenge, but Government cuts are making
his task almost impossible, and devolution

264
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,789
simply means asking us to do more with less.
We did our bit last night in setting the budget;

265
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,500
will the Prime Minister now meet the Mayor
of Bristol to discuss the fairer funding deal

266
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,220
that the people of Bristol deserve?

267
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:22,059
>>The Prime Minister: I understand that my
right hon. Friend the Communities Secretary

268
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:28,070
has indeed had such a meeting to discuss the
issue that the hon. Lady has raised.

269
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,049
>>Chris Davies (Brecon and Radnorshire) (Con):
Seventeen years ago, my constituents Sue and

270
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:41,970
Glyn Jones received a phone call that no parent
should ever have to take. The caller told

271
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,419
them that their daughter Kirsty, who was backpacking
in Thailand, had been brutally murdered. The

272
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:53,620
Thai authorities are due to close their investigation
of Kirsty’s murder soon but, as yet, her

273
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,549
case remains unsolved, her killer remains
free, and her parents have neither justice

274
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:05,830
nor closure. May I ask my right hon. Friend
to press the Thai authorities to use recently

275
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:12,140
improved DNA techniques to bring the killer
to justice, to endeavour to provide more support

276
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,400
for families who have lost loved ones abroad
and, finally, to ensure that Kirsty’s personal

277
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,230
effects are, at last, returned home to her
parents from Thailand?

278
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,899
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure that the whole
House will join me in offering condolences

279
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:33,049
to the Jones family and in recognising the
terrible trauma that they have been through

280
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:39,029
as a result of the killing of their daughter.
As I am sure that my hon. Friend appreciates,

281
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,580
it is not for the British Government to interfere
with police investigations that take place

282
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,960
in another country, but I understand that
the Foreign Office has been providing support

283
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,220
and remains ready to do so. Our embassy in
Bangkok will continue to raise these issues

284
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,321
with the Thai Government, and I am sure that
the Foreign Office will keep my hon. Friend

285
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,970
updated on any developments.

286
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,629
>>Phil Wilson (Sedgefield) (Lab): In the Prime
Minister’s Lancaster House speech, she said

287
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:07,211
of a future trade agreement with the EU:“no
deal for Britain is better than a bad deal

288
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:12,340
for Britain.”In the spirit of consistency,
will that rule also apply to any future trade

289
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,619
negotiations with the United States of America,
where President Trump has said that America

290
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:18,619
comes first?

291
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:23,490
>>The Prime Minister: I assure the hon. Gentleman
that, as I have said consistently, we will

292
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,299
be ensuring that when we negotiate trade deals
with whichever countries around the world,

293
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,200
they will be good deals for the UK.

294
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,999
>>Crispin Blunt (Reigate) (Con): In the Marriage
(Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, we took the power,

295
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:41,809
subject to a consultation and the laying of
an order, to give humanists in England and

296
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:48,110
Wales the opportunity to celebrate marriages
as they do in Scotland. We have had the consultation,

297
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,749
with 90% approval, and there has even now
been reference to the Law Commission, which

298
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:56,260
has concluded. Will my right hon. Friend now
give her attention to laying this order and

299
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,169
giving humanists in England and Wales the
same rights and freedoms as they enjoy very

300
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,769
successfully in Scotland?

301
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:08,210
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend has been
following this issue closely over recent years.

302
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,760
I think he recognises that this is an important
and complex area of law, and we want to make

303
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,330
sure that proposals are considered properly.
That is why the Ministry of Justice is carefully

304
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,249
examining the differences in treatment that
already exist within marriage law, alongside

305
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:27,380
the humanist proposals, so that the differences
can be minimised. I am sure that my hon. Friend

306
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:33,450
will agree that it is both right and fair
to approach this in that way.

307
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,440
>>Nic Dakin (Scunthorpe) (Lab): My constituent
Kevin’s chances of survival from pancreatic

308
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,809
cancer were no better than his mother’s,
who died of that disease 40 years earlier.

309
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:50,690
This disease is soon to become the fourth
biggest cancer killer in the UK. Will the

310
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:57,830
Prime Minister join MPs on both sides of this
House to champion a significant increase in

311
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:03,010
spending on pancreatic cancer research which,
sadly, currently lags behind that on other

312
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,010
cancers?

313
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:10,809
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
a very important point that is obviously of

314
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:16,360
particular relevance in the case of the constituent
to whom he refers. As he says, pancreatic

315
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,419
cancer is one of those cancers that it is
very difficult to deal with and treat. There

316
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,940
has been a lot of attention over the years
on certain cancers, such as breast cancer

317
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,899
increasingly, as well as bowel cancer and
prostate cancer, but it is important that

318
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,570
the appropriate attention is given to cancers
that are proving more difficult to deal with,

319
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,679
such as pancreatic cancer.

320
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,749
>>Neil Parish (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):
In February 2008, Mr Barry Pring, the brother

321
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:51,789
of one of my constituents, was unlawfully
killed in Ukraine. Mr Pring’s Ukrainian

322
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:59,150
wife is clearly implicated in his death. Earlier
this year, our coroner in Devon ruled that

323
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,919
Mr Pring was tricked into standing on a carriageway
before being run down by a car that had stolen

324
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,559
licence plates and no lights—death was immediate.
However, every time an investigating officer

325
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:17,110
makes progress with the case in Ukraine, they
are replaced. This has happened 10 times and

326
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:23,259
the case has stalled. May I implore my right
hon. Friend to raise this case with the Ukrainian

327
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:28,630
Prime Minister so that we can get justice
and closure for Barry’s mother and brother

328
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,009
and the Pring family?

329
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:38,409
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure that the whole
House will join me in offering condolences

330
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:43,609
to Barry’s family following his death in
2008. I understand that my hon. Friend has

331
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:48,440
discussed this case with my right hon. Friend
the Foreign Secretary. As I said in reply

332
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,049
to an earlier question, it is not for the
British Government to interfere in the legal

333
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:56,499
processes of another country, but the Foreign
Office has been regularly raising this case

334
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:01,470
with the Ukrainian authorities and will continue
to do so. It is my understanding that UK police

335
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,690
have assisted the investigation on a number
of occasions and all information from the

336
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,059
UK coroner’s inquest will be passed on.
I am sure that the Foreign Office will keep

337
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,590
my hon. Friend updated on any developments.

338
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,479
>>Gavin Newlands (Paisley and Renfrewshire
North) (SNP): Tens of thousands of disabled

339
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:19,989
people on the Motability scheme have had their
cars removed by this Government. In November,

340
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,850
the Minister for Disabled People, Health and
Work said that they will be looking at allowing

341
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,139
personal independence payment claimants to
keep their cars pending appeal. Next week,

342
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:30,920
my constituent Margaret Gibson will lose her
car, which she regards as a lifeline, despite

343
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,210
a pending appeal and two decades of receiving
higher rate disability living allowance. Will

344
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,870
the Prime Minister update the House on the
progress of this review to help Margaret and

345
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,110
thousands like her?

346
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,830
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
an issue about the way in which these assessments

347
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,820
are made and the implications of the decisions
taken. He referred, I think, to a review in

348
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,759
relation to PIP payments and the Motability
element of that. If I may, I will write to

349
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,749
him with further details.

350
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:08,409
>>Derek Thomas (St Ives) (Con): It was a year
ago this week that the Edward Hain community

351
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:13,940
hospital was temporarily closed due to fire
safety concerns. There are now no community

352
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,840
beds in the towns of St Ives, Penzance and
St Just, or in the rural areas in between.

353
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,619
GPs, residents and local campaigners agree
with me that this valued community hospital

354
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:29,940
needs to be reopened as an urgent priority.
Will my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister

355
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,320
apply pressure to NHS Property Services and
to Cornwall’s NHS managers to find a way

356
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,799
of getting that building work done and reopening
those community beds?

357
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:45,159
>>The Prime Minister: This is obviously a
concern for my hon. Friend’s constituents—he

358
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:50,159
is right to raise it. I am sure that he recognises
that the first priority must be to ensure

359
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,759
that patients are treated in a safe and secure
environment, and I understand that the local

360
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,419
clinical commissioning group and the NHS have
been working closely to ensure that community

361
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:03,809
hospital facilities in Cornwall are fit to
deliver that expectation. I think that a review

362
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:08,759
has already been undertaken into the repairs
and improvements needed to bring the Edward

363
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,570
Hain community hospital up to a safe standard,
and the CCG will be looking at the infrastructure

364
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,729
and facilities that it needs, once a final
local plan has been agreed. Obviously my right

365
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,869
hon. Friend the Health Secretary has heard
my hon. Friend’s representations.

366
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:25,450
>>Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green):
The Government’s business rates hike could

367
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:31,750
devastate the local economy in my constituency.
Brighton pier is facing a 17% increase, the

368
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:39,129
World’s End pub a 123% increase, and Blanch
House hotel a 400% increase. Does the Prime

369
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:46,350
Minister recognise that Brighton will be disproportionately
affected? Will she urgently set up a discretionary

370
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,000
fund to support small and micro-businesses,
and agree to a full review of the whole system?

371
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,389
>>The Prime Minister: If we just stand back,
we can see that business rates are based on

372
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:02,590
the rental values of properties. Those values
change over time—they can go up and down—and

373
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:08,549
it is right that business rates change to
recognise that. That is the principle of fairness

374
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:12,980
that underpins the business rates system.
However, we also want to support businesses

375
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,000
and we recognise that, for some, business
rates will go up when the revaluations take

376
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,550
place. That is why we have put significant
funding in place for transitional relief.

377
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:29,470
I recognise that there has been particular
concern that some small businesses will be

378
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:34,658
adversely affected as the result of this revaluation,
and that is why I have asked the Chancellor

379
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,480
and the Communities Secretary to ensure that
there is appropriate relief in those hardest

380
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,790
cases.

381
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:49,539
>>Sir Julian Brazier (Canterbury) (Con): My
right hon. Friend gave a sympathetic answer

382
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,250
to my right hon. Friend the Member for New
Forest East (Dr Lewis) and I know that she

383
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,380
has taken particular interest in the matter
that he raised. May I put it to her that,

384
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,780
for many of us, there is something profoundly
wrong with a criminal justice system that

385
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,289
can pursue veterans who have risked their
lives for this country 40 years on, long after

386
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:15,490
there is any possibility of new evidence,
while it is at the same time capable of paying

387
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,420
out £1 million to a terror suspect?

388
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:29,049
>>The Prime Minister: In relation to the issue
in Northern Ireland, the legacy bodies were

389
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:35,170
part of the Stormont House agreement and we
are working to deliver on that agreement.

390
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,960
As I said in reply to my right hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis),

391
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,619
the overwhelming majority of our armed forces
in Northern Ireland served with great distinction

392
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:51,400
and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.
The situation at the moment is that cases

393
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,289
are being pursued against officers who served
in Northern Ireland, and we want to see the

394
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,950
legacy body set up under the Stormont House
agreement taking a proportionate, fair and

395
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:12,640
balanced approach. As I said earlier, we recognise
that the majority of individuals who suffered

396
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,589
did so at the hands of terrorists.

397
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,720
>>Andy Burnham (Leigh) (Lab): On the steps
of Downing Street, the Prime Minister pledged

398
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,020
to end the “burning injustice” of so few
working-class boys going to university. Will

399
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,990
she tell me how cutting every single secondary
school in Leigh, Wigan, Rochdale, Trafford

400
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,560
and Manchester through her new schools funding
formula will do anything other than make that

401
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,119
injustice even worse?

402
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,800
>>The Prime Minister: I want to ensure, through
the education system that we provide, that

403
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,210
there is a good school place for every child.
I am pleased to say that under Conservatives

404
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:54,961
in government, we have seen 1.8 million more
children in good or outstanding schools. We

405
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:59,960
are looking at the funding formula for schools
and listening to the comments that have been

406
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,190
made, but everyone across the House will recognise
that it has been said for some time now that

407
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:12,481
the existing formula is not transparent or
fair. We are looking at a new formula, but

408
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:17,049
I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that
our education policy is about ensuring that

409
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:24,580
every child has the opportunity to go as far
as their talents and their hard work enable

410
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,859
them to go.

411
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,710
>>Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam) (Con): Mr
Speaker, you saw at first hand what a cup

412
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:40,079
run means to a town and a club such as Sutton.
With AFC Wimbledon out of the picture, I wonder

413
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,900
whether my right hon. Friend will join me
in congratulating Sutton United on such a

414
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:51,510
spirited performance on Monday, and in wishing
Lincoln City well for keeping the non-league

415
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,380
spirit alive in the next round of the FA cup.
Finally—[Interruption.]

416
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,910
>>Mr Speaker: Order. The hon. Gentleman must
be heard.

417
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:04,030
>>Paul Scully: Finally, will my right hon.
Friend join me in congratulating and thanking

418
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:11,960
Arsenal for their generosity in allowing Sutton
to keep a little extra slice of the FA cup

419
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
pie?

420
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:21,740
>>The Prime Minister: If I may say so, that
was a neat reference to pie at the end of

421
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:34,750
the question. I am happy to congratulate Sutton
on their extremely good run in the FA cup.

422
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:41,230
It makes a huge difference to a local area
when its football club is able to progress

423
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,770
to that extent, to be up there with the big
boys, and to do as well as Sutton did. I am

424
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,612
also happy to congratulate Lincoln City—I
see that my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln

425
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:53,039
is sitting next to my hon. Friend the Member
for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Scully)—on their

426
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,599
success. We wish them well for the future.

427
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,190
>>Mr Speaker: Finally, I call Michelle Thomson.

428
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,809
>>Michelle Thomson (Edinburgh West) (Ind):
The UK Green Investment Bank, which is co-located

429
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:09,539
in Edinburgh, is being sold, and recent newspaper
reports suggest that the contract could be

430
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:14,869
concluded soon. That is happening despite
the UK’s stated focus on research and development,

431
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,670
and the fact that no realistic guarantees
have yet been given as to the continuation

432
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:26,510
of a proper headquarters and board based in
Edinburgh. Will the Prime Minister commit

433
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:33,762
to looking again at why a sale at this time
is not in the best interests of Edinburgh,

434
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,940
the green agenda or UK taxpayers?

435
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,670
>>The Prime Minister: Before I respond to
the hon. Lady’s question, I am afraid that

436
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:48,560
I owe a couple of apologies. I am sorry for
mixing up my hon. Friends the Members for

437
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,369
Stroud (Neil Carmichael) and for Lincoln (Karl
MᶜCartney). I was obviously getting carried

438
00:39:52,369 --> 00:40:00,410
away with the football fever that my hon.
Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam introduced

439
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,410
into the Chamber.

440
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,410
The hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Michelle
