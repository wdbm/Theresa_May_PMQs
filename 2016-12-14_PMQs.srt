1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,540
>>Peter Dowd (Bootle) (Lab): May I take the
opportunity to wish you, Mr Speaker, and all

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:11,080
Members of the House a merry Christmas and
a happy new year?

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,900
In the light of the Foreign Secretary’s
display of chronic “foot in mouth” disease,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,580
when deciding on Cabinet positions, does the
Prime Minister now regret that pencilling

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:32,550
“FO” against his name should have been
an instruction, not a job offer?

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:44,829
>>Mr Speaker: Order. There is far too much
noise in the Chamber. We have heard the question,

7
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,170
but I want to hear the Prime Minister’s
answer.

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,249
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
join the hon. Gentleman in wishing everybody

9
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:59,730
a happy Christmas. I will of course have an
opportunity to do that again on Monday, when

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,269
I am sure the House will be as full for the
statement on the European Council meeting.

11
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,080
[Hon. Members: “Hear, hear.] Funny, that
seemed to come from this side of the House

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,610
but not from the Labour side. I have to say
that the Foreign Secretary is doing an absolutely

13
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:24,470
excellent job. He is, in short, an FFS—a
fine Foreign Secretary.

14
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:35,300
>>Amanda Milling (Cannock Chase) (Con): Rugeley
has a really bright future ahead—[Interruption.]

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,930
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I want to hear the voice
of Cannock Chase.

16
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:46,860
>>Amanda Milling (Cannock Chase) (Con): Rugeley
has a really bright future ahead, but only

17
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,360
if we are ambitious, bold and visionary in
our redevelopment plans. Will my right hon.

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,520
Friend outline how the Government’s industrial
strategy can create the conditions that will

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,640
help us to build a sustainable local economy
and highly skilled jobs for future generations?

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,269
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right that communities across this country

21
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:16,569
have a bright future ahead of them, but we
need to ensure that we create the conditions

22
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,249
for that future. That is why we will be producing
a modern industrial strategy that will show

23
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:27,209
how we can encourage the strategic strengths
of the United Kingdom and deal with our underlying

24
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,469
weaknesses. It will enable companies to grow,
invest in the UK and provide those jobs for

25
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,209
the future, but we also need to make sure
that that prosperity is spread across the

26
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,280
whole of the United Kingdom and is prosperity
for everyone.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:51,719
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): May
I start by wishing you, Mr Speaker, all Members

28
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,639
of the House and everyone who works in the
House a very happy Christmas and a prosperous

29
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,690
new year?

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,840
Sadly, our late colleague Jo Cox will not
be celebrating Christmas this year with her

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,452
family. She was murdered and taken from us,
so I hope the Prime Minister will join me—I

32
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:14,480
am sure she will—in encouraging people to
download the song, which many Members helped

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,209
to create, as a tribute to Jo’s life and
work and in everlasting memory of her.

34
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,870
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
is absolutely right to raise this issue. I

35
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,689
am sure that everybody in this House would
wish to send a very clear message: download

36
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:35,599
this single for the Jo Cox Foundation. It
is a very important cause. We all recognise

37
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,959
that Jo Cox was a fine Member of this House
and would have carried on contributing significantly

38
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,099
to this House and to this country, had she
not been brutally murdered. It is right that

39
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:52,489
the Chancellor has waived VAT on the single.
Everybody involved in it gave their services

40
00:03:52,489 --> 00:04:06,569
for free, and I am having a photograph with
MP4 later this afternoon. Once again, let

41
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,230
us encourage everybody to download the single.

42
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,230
>>Mr Speaker: For the benefit of those observing
our proceedings from outside, I should state

43
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,359
that the Prime Minister was, of course, referring
to the outstanding parliamentary rock band

44
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,358
MP4.

45
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,819
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I applaud the work of MP4,
but for the benefit of air quality I am not

46
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:33,060
a member of it! I thank the Prime Minister
for her answer.

47
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,919
Social care is crucial. It provides support
for people to live with dignity, yet Age UK

48
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,000
research has found that 1.2 million older
people are currently not receiving the care

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,699
they need. Will the Prime Minister accept
that there is a crisis in social care?

50
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:59,280
>>The Prime Minister: I have consistently
said in this House that we recognise the pressures

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,490
on social care, so it might be helpful if
I set out what the Government are doing and

52
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,091
the position in relation to social care. As
I say, we recognise those pressures. That

53
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:11,800
is why the Government are putting more money
into social care through the better care fund,

54
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,120
and by the end of this Parliament it will
be billions of pounds extra. That is why we

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,220
have enabled the social care precept for local
authorities. We recognise that there are immediate

56
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,819
pressures on social care. That is why this
will be addressed tomorrow by my right hon.

57
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,150
Friend the Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government in the local government

58
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:36,830
finance settlement. We also recognise that
this is not just about money; it is about

59
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,590
delivery. There is a difference in delivery
across the country. We need to make sure that

60
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,280
reform is taking place, so we see best practice
in the integration of health and social care

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,500
across the country. We also need to ensure
that we have a longer-term solution to give

62
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,720
people reassurance for the future that there
is a sustainable system that will ensure that

63
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,520
they receive the social care they need in
old age. That is what the Government are working

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,819
on. There is a short-term issue; there is
medium-term need to make sure local authorities

65
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,569
and the health service are delivering consistently;
and there is a long-term solution that we

66
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,569
need to find.

67
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:20,320
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Care Quality Commission
warned as recently as October that evidence

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,930
suggests we have approached a tipping point.
Instead of passing the buck on to local government,

69
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,711
should not the Government take responsibility
for the crisis themselves? Will the Prime

70
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:36,280
Minister take this opportunity to inform the
House exactly how much was cut from the social

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,290
care budget in the last Parliament?

72
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,560
>>The Prime Minister: We have been putting
more money into social care and health [Hon.

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,469
Members: “How much?”]. We have been putting
more money in and, as I say, we recognise

74
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:58,120
the pressures that exist. That is why we are
looking at the short-term pressures on social

75
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,580
care, but this cannot be looked at as simply
being an issue of money in the short term.

76
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,009
It is about delivery; it is about reform;
it is about the social care system working

77
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,849
with the health system. That is why this issue
is being addressed not just by the Secretary

78
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,229
of State for Communities and Local Government,
but by the Secretary of State for Health.

79
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:25,639
If we are going to give people the reassurance
they need in the longer term that their social

80
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,580
care needs will be met, we need to make it
clear that this is not just about looking

81
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,310
for a short-term solution. It is about finding
a way forward that can give us a sustainable

82
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,580
system of social care for the future.

83
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,669
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Prime Minister does not
seem to be aware that £4.6 billion was cut

84
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:48,539
from the social care budget in the last Parliament.
Her talk about putting this on to local government

85
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,530
ought to be taken for what it is—a con.
Two per cent. of council tax is clearly a

86
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:03,009
nonsense; 95% of councils used the social
care precept, and it raised less than 3% of

87
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,689
the money they planned to spend on adult social
care. Billions seem to be available for tax

88
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,880
give-aways to corporations—not mentioned
in the autumn statement—and underfunding

89
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,289
has left many elderly people isolated and
in crisis because of the lack of Government

90
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,110
funding for social care.

91
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,870
>>The Prime Minister: Many councils around
the country have taken the benefit of the

92
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,370
social care precept and as a result have actually
seen more people being able to access social

93
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,660
care and more needs being met. Sadly, there
are some councils across the country—some

94
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,339
Labour councils—that have not taken that
opportunity and we see worse performance on

95
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,490
social care. The right hon. Gentleman once
again referred to money, so I remind him that

96
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,870
the then shadow Chancellor said at the last
election that if Labour was in government

97
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:04,420
there would be “not a penny more” for
local authorities. When recently asked about

98
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,370
spending more money on social care and where
the money would come from, Labour’s shadow

99
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,370
Health Secretary said:

100
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,130
“Well, we’re going to have to come up
with a plan for that”.

101
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:25,500
>>Jeremy Corbyn: This Government have cut
social care and the Prime Minister well knows

102
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,320
it, and she well knows the effects of that.
She also well knows that raising council tax

103
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,630
has different outcomes in different parts
of the country. If you raise the council tax

104
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,990
precept in Windsor and Maidenhead, you get
quite a lot of money. If you raise the council

105
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:50,180
tax precept in Liverpool or Newcastle, you
get a lot less. Is the Prime Minister saying

106
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,460
that frail, elderly, vulnerable people in
our big cities are less valuable than those

107
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,930
in wealthier parts of the country?

108
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:08,490
This is a crisis for many elderly people who
are living in a difficult situation, but it

109
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:16,050
is also a crisis for the national health service.
People in hospital cannot be discharged because

110
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,839
there is nowhere for them to go. I ask the
Prime Minister again: the crisis affects individuals,

111
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,000
families and the national health service,
so why does she not do something really bold:

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,960
cancel the corporation tax cut and put the
money into social care instead?

113
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:43,220
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
referred to Newcastle council in his list.

114
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,010
I have to say that Newcastle City Council
is one of the councils that saw virtually

115
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,750
no delayed discharges in September, so elderly
people were not being held up in hospital

116
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,279
when they did not need or want to be. That
shows that it is possible for councils to

117
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,949
deliver on the ground. Councils such as Newcastle
and Torbay are doing that, but councils such

118
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:11,630
as Ealing are not using the social care precept
and the result is different. The difference

119
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:17,019
between the worst performing council in relation
to delayed discharges and the best is twentyfold.

120
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:21,870
That is not about the difference in funding;
it is about the difference in delivery.

121
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:30,480
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Councils across the country
work hard to try to cope with a 40% cut in

122
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,290
their budgets, and the people paying the price
are those who are stuck in hospital who should

123
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,010
be allowed to go home and those who are not
getting the care and support they need. The

124
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,649
social care system is deep in crisis. The
crisis was made in Downing Street by this

125
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,300
Government. The former Chair of the Health
Committee, Stephen Dorrell, says that the

126
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,529
system is inadequately funded. The current
Chair of the Health Committee, the hon. Member

127
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:58,870
for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), said that

128
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,420
“this issue can’t be ducked any longer
because of the impact it is having not just

129
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,100
on vulnerable people, but also on the NHS.”

130
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,170
Why does the Prime Minister not listen to
local government, the King’s Fund, the NHS

131
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,060
Confederation and her own council leaders
and recognise that this social care crisis

132
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,980
forces people to give up work to care for
loved ones because there is no system to do

133
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,519
that? It makes people stay in hospital longer
than they should and leads people into a horrible,

134
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,790
isolated life when they should be cared for
by all of us through a properly funded social

135
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,490
care system. Get a grip and fund it properly,
please.

136
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:46,170
>>The Prime Minister: The issue of social
care has been ducked by Governments for too

137
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:55,380
long. That is why this Government will provide
a long-term sustainable system for social

138
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,259
care that gives people reassurance. The right
hon. Gentleman talks about Governments ducking

139
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:14,500
social care, so let us look at the 13 years
of Labour government. In 1997, they said in

140
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,829
their manifesto that they would sort it. They
had a royal commission in 1999, a Green Paper

141
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:27,870
in 2005 and the Wanless report in 2006. They
said they would sort it in the 2007 comprehensive

142
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:36,300
spending review. In 2009, they had another
Green Paper: 13 years and no action whatsoever.

143
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:47,589
>>Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham)
(Con): Today, a constituent of mine from Shoreham

144
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,070
will struggle to get to University College
hospital, London, for life-saving cancer drug

145
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,610
trials, and across Sussex thousands of others
will be unable to get to work, to school or

146
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,899
to college because ASLEF objects to their
drivers on Southern operating the doors. Yet

147
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,790
today, ASLEF drivers will be driving Thameslink
trains on the same rails, operating the doors

148
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,899
on the London to Brighton line. Can the Prime
Minister give her assurance that everything

149
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:18,399
will be done at the ACAS talks today to end
this nonsense of a strike, address any residual

150
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,360
safety issues and give our constituents their
lives back?

151
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,040
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right to raise this issue. This is an appalling

152
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,279
strike and he is right to raise the discrepancy
in the attitude of ASLEF; we have seen driver-only

153
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,750
operated trains on rail networks in the UK
for decades and they are on Thameslink. I

154
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:48,300
hope that the talks at ACAS are going to lead
to an end to this strike, but I have a suggestion

155
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:55,810
for the Leader of the Opposition, as he could
do something to help members of the public.

156
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,500
The Labour party is funded by ASLEF. Why does
he not get on the phone and tell it to call

157
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,000
the strike off immediately?

158
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:20,880
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): We join the
leader of the Labour party and the Prime Minister

159
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,529
in wishing great success to the Jo Cox single,
which is available for download on Friday—I

160
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,639
am sure we are all going to download it.

161
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:36,560
Civilians have suffered grievously from the
bombing of hospitals, schools and markets.

162
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,250
The United Nations believes that 60% of civilian
casualties are caused by airstrikes. In the

163
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:50,220
past 24 hours, the United States has stopped
the supply of precision-guided munitions to

164
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,279
Saudi Arabia to bomb Yemen. When will the
UK follow suit?

165
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,110
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, we have a very strict regime of export

166
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:08,149
licences in relation to weapons here in the
United Kingdom. We exercise that very carefully,

167
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:15,990
and in recent years we have indeed refused
export licences in relation to arms, including

168
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,379
to Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

169
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,879
>>Angus Robertson: The US Government have
just said that

170
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:29,819
“systematic, endemic problems in Saudi Arabia’s
targeting drove the US decision to halt a

171
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:34,120
future weapons sale involving precision-guided
munitions”.

172
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:42,269
The Saudis have UK-supplied precision-guided
Paveway IV missiles—they are made in Scotland.

173
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,529
The UK has licensed £3.3 billion-worth of
arms to Saudi Arabia since the beginning of

174
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:53,089
the bombing campaign. What will it take for
the UK to adopt an ethical foreign policy

175
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,389
when it comes to Yemen?

176
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,589
The Prime Minister
As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the intervention

177
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:07,350
in Yemen is a UN-backed intervention. As I
have said previously, where there are allegations

178
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:13,349
of breaches of international humanitarian
law, we require those to be properly investigated.

179
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:19,208
We do have a relationship with Saudi Arabia.
The security of the Gulf is important to us,

180
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,699
and I would simply also remind him that Saudi
intelligence—the counter-terrorism links

181
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,820
we have with Saudi Arabia and the intelligence
we get from Saudi Arabia—has saved potentially

182
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,260
hundreds of lives here in the UK.

183
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,919
>>Dr Sarah Wollaston (Totnes) (Con): One of
my constituents has just had to move to residential

184
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,660
care because no carers could be found to support
her in her own home. She is at the sharp end

185
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,370
of a crisis in social care that is as much
about inadequate funding as it is about a

186
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:58,590
shortfall in our very valued social care workforce.
I am looking forward to hearing what immediate

187
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,440
further support will be provided for social
care, but is it not time that rather than

188
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,580
having confrontational dialogues about social
care funding, all parties work together, across

189
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:15,490
this House, to look for a sustainable long-term
solution for the funding of both integrated

190
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,900
health and social care?

191
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,370
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is right
to raise the issue of looking at a sustainable

192
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:28,261
way in which we can support integrated health
and social care, and a sustainable way for

193
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,400
people to know that in the future they are
going to be able to have the social care that

194
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,360
they require. As I said earlier in response
to the Leader of the Opposition, we recognise

195
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,620
the short-term pressures that there are on
the system, but it is important for us to

196
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,370
look at those medium-term and longer-term
solutions if we are going to be able to address

197
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,110
this issue. I was very pleased to be able
to have a meeting with my hon. Friend to discuss

198
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,710
this last week, and I look forward to further
such meetings.

199
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,610
>>Mark Durkan (Foyle) (SDLP): A cross-party
delegation led by the right hon. Member for

200
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,720
Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) will meet the Russian
ambassador tomorrow morning to discuss Aleppo.

201
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,860
We will reflect and amplify the sort of terms
that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary

202
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,330
have used about Russia, the Assad regime and
Iran, not least because we want to protect

203
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,910
those who have heroically struggled to save
lives in that city and who will now be at

204
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,130
particular risk because of what they have
witnessed. Does the Prime Minister accept

205
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,200
that many of us believe that these messages
are more cogent when we are equally unequivocal

206
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,060
about the primacy of human rights and international
humanitarian law when we meet the Gulf states?

207
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,530
>>The Prime Minister: We do raise the issue
of human rights when we meet the Gulf states,

208
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,730
but the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right
in relation to the role that Russia is playing

209
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:50,789
in Syria. There is a very simple message for
President Putin. He has it within his own

210
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:56,900
hands to say to the Assad regime that enough
is enough in Aleppo. We need to ensure that

211
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,280
humanitarian aid is there for people and that
there is security for the people who have,

212
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:08,919
as the hon. Gentleman has said, been heroically
saving the lives of others. I am sure that

213
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,549
that is a message that he and others will
be giving to the Russian ambassador. It is

214
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,190
in President Putin’s hands; he can do it,
why does he not?

215
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,700
>>Victoria Prentis (Banbury) (Con): On the
same subject, will the Prime Minister join

216
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,610
me in thanking the many Members from all parts
of this House who sung for Syrians last night

217
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:31,820
in St Margaret’s, Westminster? Singing for
Syrians was created to pay the salaries of

218
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:39,029
the medical staff in Aleppo. Since our hospital
was bombed two weeks ago, we have been buying

219
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:45,950
prosthetic limbs with all our money. We have
a waiting list of 30,000 people. What can

220
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,450
we do to target our humanitarian aid to ensure
that it gets to the most vulnerable people

221
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,120
in Syria—the old, the very young, and people
who are too injured to move?

222
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,770
>>The Prime Minister: First of all, I absolutely
join my hon. Friend in congratulating everyone

223
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:08,029
who took part in Singing for Syrians. I am
sure the whole House welcomes the work that

224
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:14,760
that group is doing and the money that it
is raising and putting to extremely good use.

225
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,590
The House was struck when she mentioned the
number of people who are on the waiting list

226
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:27,510
for prosthetic limbs. Our humanitarian aid
support for Syria is the biggest such effort

227
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:35,720
that the UK has made. Of course we are giving
money to the refugees who have fled from Syria.

228
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,210
We are also working diplomatically to try
to reduce the suffering and to ensure that

229
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,190
the sort of aid and medical support that she
is talking gets through to the citizens of

230
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,429
Aleppo. We will continue to ensure that our
humanitarian aid is being put to good use—helping

231
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:59,049
those who are vulnerable and also helping
those who need the education and support to

232
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:04,590
be able, in due course, to rebuild Syria when
it is stable and secure.

233
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:11,909
>>Nick Smith (Blaenau Gwent) (Lab): Rip-off
interest rates on household goods are wrong.

234
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:18,470
Companies such as BrightHouse exploit families
who have no other way to furnish their homes.

235
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,630
Will the Prime Minister look at capping those
interest rates to help those who are just

236
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,850
about managing?

237
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,520
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
an important issue. I recognise that there

238
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,240
are many people who are just about managing
and struggling to get by who find themselves

239
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,490
having to revert to support from companies
that do, sadly, charge the sort of interest

240
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,730
rates that he is talking about. Action has
been taken in relation to some of those activities

241
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,630
in the past, but I will look at the issue
that he raised.

242
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:02,640
>>Helen Whately (Faversham and Mid Kent) (Con):
Across the country, and particularly in Kent,

243
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,870
lorry fly-parking is a blight. It is antisocial
and dangerous. Will my right hon. Friend the

244
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:15,490
Prime Minister support my campaign for more
lorry parking spaces, more effective enforcement

245
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,630
and, ultimately, a ban on lorries parking
in unauthorised places?

246
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,730
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the concern
that my hon. Friend has raised; it is one

247
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:32,000
that is shared by many Kent MPs who see this
problem only too closely in their own constituencies.

248
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,830
May I assure her that the Government share
the desire to ensure that we do not see this

249
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,200
fly-parking of lorries across Kent and that
we do provide suitable lorry parking facilities

250
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,059
in Kent? I know that the Under-Secretary of
State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member

251
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:49,120
for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Andrew Jones),
is looking at this issue very carefully. I

252
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,240
recognise, from my time as Home Secretary,
the pressure that can be put on the roads,

253
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,799
villages and towns in Kent at particular times.
The Government are working on it, and we will

254
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,399
find a solution.

255
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:09,679
>>Ian Blackford (Ross, Skye and Lochaber)
(SNP): Now we know, courtesy of the Government’s

256
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,059
infrastructure watchdog, that mobile coverage
in the UK is worse than in Romania, will the

257
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:22,029
Prime Minister take steps to introduce a universal
service obligation? In the highlands it is

258
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:27,890
fairly typical to get the message, “No signal.”
It would often be better to use carrier pigeons.

259
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,500
Does the Prime Minister recognise that that
is not acceptable, and will she take responsibility?

260
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,810
It is time to connect the highlands to the
rest of the world.

261
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:46,000
>>The Prime Minister: I can assure the hon.
Gentleman that the issue of decent mobile

262
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,780
coverage does not only affect the highlands.
There are parts of England, Wales and Northern

263
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,470
Ireland that are also affected. The Government
have very strong commitments in relation to

264
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,210
this; we have very strong commitments in relation
to broadband. My right hon. Friend the Secretary

265
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,250
of State for Culture, Media and Sport will
deliver on those.

266
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:14,090
>>Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) (Con): Money cannot
compensate someone who has been accused of

267
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,880
a very serious criminal offence and who then
finds that the details are in the press along

268
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,820
with their name. Nothing, in truth, can restore
their reputation after it has been trashed

269
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,549
in those circumstances. In 2011, I tried to
change the law with a private Member’s Bill.

270
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:37,440
Today, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that it
was time to introduce new legislation. Will

271
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,450
the Prime Minister agree at least to consider
changing the law so that everyone, with a

272
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,870
few exceptions, has the right to anonymity
if they are a suspect in criminal proceedings

273
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,130
until such time as they are charged?

274
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:59,460
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the interest
that my right hon. Friend takes in this issue.

275
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,120
She will know that it has been debated on
a number of occasions in the House. The general

276
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:14,590
assumption is that someone should not be named
before the point of charge, but there is an

277
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,760
allowance for the police to be able to raise
someone’s name if it is a case where they

278
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,621
believe that doing so will perhaps help other
victims to come forward. This is of particular

279
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:31,669
concern in matters of sexual violence—rape,
for example—or where the police believe

280
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:38,610
that the naming of an individual will help
in the detection of the crime. This is a delicate

281
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,000
issue, and I recognise my right hon. Friend’s
concern. The College of Policing is looking

282
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,190
at it very carefully, and is due to provide
new guidance to the police in the new year

283
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,340
in relation to the media.

284
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,299
>>Lucy Powell (Manchester Central) (Lab/Co-op):
The heart-breaking humanitarian crisis and

285
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:04,160
genocide in Syria continue to take place as
the world watches impotently, yet there is

286
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,380
no end in sight. Does the Prime Minister agree
with the right hon. Member for Tatton (Mr

287
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,390
Osborne) that what is happening in Syria is
a failure of western leadership, and does

288
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:23,630
she agree with me that what is urgently required
is what our dear friend, Jo Cox, called for

289
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:32,710
nearly a year ago: a UK-led strategy to protect
civilians, whether they are fleeing persecution,

290
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,309
whether they are surrendering, or whether
they are still besieged?

291
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:43,570
>>The Prime Minister: We must all take responsibility
for decisions that we have taken, whether

292
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,710
we take them sitting around the National Security
Council table or, indeed, whether we take

293
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:58,210
them in the House, with the decision it took
in 2013. The hon. Lady raised the question

294
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:04,830
of UK-led action in relation to the protection
of civilians. The UK has been pressing for

295
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,141
action in the United Nations Security Council,
working with the French. The two most recent

296
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:15,450
emergency UN Security Council meetings were
called for by us, and the most recent took

297
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,510
place yesterday. As she will know, there have
been six UN Security Council resolutions which

298
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:28,620
have been vetoed by Russia. The most recent
was also vetoed by China. We continue to work

299
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,990
with the United Nations, but if we are to
get a solution that works on the ground other

300
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:39,809
countries have to buy into it, and it has
to be a solution that Russia buys into, as

301
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,590
well as the regime.

302
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:50,470
>>Robert Jenrick (Newark) (Con): I have received
a message from Nick from Grantham—actually,

303
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,400
it was a text message from our hon. Friend
the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick

304
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,730
Boles). For the avoidance of doubt, this is
one text message that he is willing to have

305
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,570
read out in public. Other than getting rid
of his tumour and making a swift return to

306
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,840
this place, nothing matters more to him than
ensuring that round-the-clock emergency services

307
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:20,080
are restored to his local hospital in Grantham.
Will my right hon. Friend receive the petition

308
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,580
that he has organised, ensure that the passionate
views of his constituents are heard, and above

309
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,690
all reassure people in that rural area that
they will always have access to safe emergency

310
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,530
care for them and their families?

311
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:42,659
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure the thoughts
of the whole House are with our hon. Friend

312
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:48,169
the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick
Boles), and I wish him the very best for his

313
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:54,850
recovery as he goes through this illness.
I recognise the strength of feeling he has

314
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:03,300
about the emergency services in his local
hospital. I believe that those concerns are

315
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:10,580
shared by our new hon. Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham (Dr Johnson). I

316
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,970
can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham
and Stamford that the process that is taking

317
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,210
place, which is looking at the development
of local services, is about listening to local

318
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,870
people, hearing the local voice and, above
all, ensuring that the services available

319
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,230
to people in their local area are the right
services for that area and that they can be

320
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,880
delivered safely and securely for local people.

321
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,169
>>Justin Madders (Ellesmere Port and Neston)
(Lab): At the last election the Conservative

322
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:44,580
party manifesto said that“we will help local
authorities keep council tax low for hardworking

323
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,090
taxpayers, and ensure residents can continue
to veto high rises”.Band D council tax payers

324
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,550
in Ellesmere Port and Neston now face paying
an extra £125 a year, with no veto, because

325
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,690
of the Government’s failure to tackle the
social care crisis. Will the Prime Minister

326
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,580
now admit that her party’s pledge on council
tax has been abandoned?

327
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,580
>>The Prime Minister: Obviously we have put
the social care precept in place in recognition

328
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,220
of the pressures on social care, but I am
very pleased to say that we have seen many

329
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:20,110
examples over the country of good local authorities
ensuring that they are keeping council tax

330
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,950
down, including the Royal Borough of Windsor
and Maidenhead, which cut council tax for

331
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,179
six years running.

332
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:33,580
>>Gareth Johnson (Dartford) (Con): On 14 August
my constituents George Low and Ben Barker

333
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,260
were the victims of a vicious knife attack
in Ayia Napa. George Low, sadly, died later

334
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:45,210
that day from his injuries. The two culprits
fled to northern Cyprus, where they were arrested

335
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:51,141
on unrelated matters. Despite representations
made by the Foreign Office, one of those men

336
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:58,610
was recently able to walk free, and it is
feared that the second man will follow shortly.

337
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:03,520
Will the Prime Minister do all she can to
help to bring justice for George Low and Ben

338
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,059
Barker for what was an horrific, vicious attack
that was completely without provocation and

339
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,330
has been devastating for both their families?

340
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:19,010
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure all of us
across the House send our deepest sympathies

341
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,860
to the family of George Low, and our very
best wishes to Ben Barker for a full recovery

342
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,410
from the terrible injuries that he suffered
as a result of what was, as my hon. Friend

343
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:36,090
said, a violent and completely unprovoked
attack. The case was raised most recently

344
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:42,710
with the relevant Government by the Foreign
Secretary during his visit to Cyprus on 30

345
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,919
November, and he set out clearly our desire
to see those guilty of this attack brought

346
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,750
to justice. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
will continue to offer help and support to

347
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,429
both families. We will continue to raise this
issue, and I am sure the Foreign and Commonwealth

348
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,260
Office will keep my hon. Friend informed of
any developments.

349
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,789
>>Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP): The Arbroath smokie,
along with many other food and drink products,

350
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,760
has benefited greatly from the European Union’s
protected geographical indication scheme.

351
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,179
What guarantee can the Prime Minister give
us that it will continue to get that protection,

352
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:21,639
should we end up leaving 
the EU?

353
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:25,850
>>The Prime Minister: We will need to address
such issues as we look at the arrangements

354
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,080
that will be in place following our exit from
the EU. I am sure everybody recognises the

355
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,059
significance of the Arbroath smokie and other
products from around the United Kingdom. At

356
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:44,080
the end of his question the hon. Gentleman
said “should we leave the EU”. I can tell

357
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,750
him that we will be leaving the EU.

358
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:58,059
>>Derek Thomas (St Ives) (Con): On 19 December
35 years ago, 16 people lost their lives in

359
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:02,779
ferocious storms off the coast of west Cornwall.
Eight of them were men from Mousehole, who

360
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:09,230
had launched the Penlee lifeboat, the Solomon
Browne, to rescue the crew of the Union Star.

361
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,660
Thirty-five years later, this tragedy still
haunts the village of Mousehole and West Penwith,

362
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:18,249
and many people mark the anniversary every
year. Will the Prime Minister join me in remembering

363
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,830
these brave men and the loved ones they left
behind, and pay credit to all our lifeboat

364
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:27,680
men and women, who are prepared to risk their
lives for those in peril on the sea?

365
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,089
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising this issue. I absolutely join

366
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:39,040
him in marking the 35th anniversary of the
Penlee lifeboat tragedy and in sending our

367
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,730
sympathies to all those families who were
affected, but also to the local communities

368
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,910
who were affected, as he has set out. I am
sure everybody in this House would want to

369
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,549
pay tribute to the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution as well and the tireless work

370
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:58,760
it does. As an island, it is important that
we have that security and safety around our

371
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,590
shores. The RNLI works tirelessly to protect
people who, as he said, are in peril on the

372
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,370
sea, and we pay tribute to it.

373
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,360
>>Ms Gisela Stuart (Birmingham, Edgbaston)
(Lab): The Prime Minister knows that I and

374
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,530
colleagues from all parties on both sides
of the House are keen to guarantee the rights

375
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,390
of some 3 million EU and European economic
area citizens in this country at the earliest

376
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:23,850
possible date. This will be the largest administrative
task the Home Office has ever undertaken.

377
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,071
Could I encourage her to look at the report
produced by British Future, which has some

378
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:32,060
very practical suggestions on how the Home
Office can implement this, and could I possibly

379
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,420
even encourage the Home Secretary to update
us on any progress made?

380
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,280
>>The Prime Minister: I say to the hon. Lady
that I am keen to ensure that we can protect

381
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,010
the rights of EU citizens living here, but
I am also keen that the rights of UK citizens

382
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:50,200
who are living in the EU are protected as
well. The Home Secretary, I think, is aware

383
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,550
of the proposals that have been put forward
and is looking at them very carefully.

384
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,910
>>Lucy Frazer (South East Cambridgeshire)
(Con): In October, hundreds of people from

385
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:06,370
across Europe attended a neo-Nazi rally in
Haddenham, a small village in my rural constituency.

386
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,810
What steps is the Prime Minister taking to
tackle racial hatred?

387
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,570
>>The Prime Minister: First of all, can we
once again, from this House, send a very clear

388
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,900
message that there is no place for racial
hatred in our society? This is so important.

389
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,630
The Home Office has done a lot of work on
racial hatred and hate crime. It has published

390
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,700
a hate crime action plan, which shows what
we are going to be doing during the lifetime

391
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,950
of this Government. Of course, earlier this
week, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary

392
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:40,200
proscribed the right-wing organisation National
Action, which means that being a member of,

393
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,620
or inviting support for, that organisation
will be a criminal offence. It is important

394
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,900
that we take every step we can to stop racial
hatred in this country, and I was pleased

395
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,590
to announce on Monday that Britain will be
the first country in Europe to adopt the International

396
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,260
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition
of anti-Semitism.

397
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:03,750
>>Naz Shah (Bradford West) (Lab): Yesterday,
I met the chief executive officer of Provident

398
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,160
Financial, one of two FTSE 100 companies in
Bradford—yes, outside London, right in the

399
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,970
heart of the north, Provident being in my
constituency. We agreed that for Bradford

400
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,580
to fulfil the potential of its young people,
we need to have better educational outcomes

401
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,100
and better transport. We have been overlooked
for too long, so can I invite the Prime Minister

402
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,090
to come to, and meet the leaders of, my great
city, and pave the way for long-overdue investment

403
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,090
for Bradford?

404
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:36,620
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady is right
to raise the role that education plays in

405
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,721
ensuring the futures of young people in Bradford.
That is why I am pleased to say that there

406
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:45,840
has been an increase of nearly 16,000 children
in Bradford who have been at good or outstanding

407
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,950
schools since 2010. We are taking action to
ensure the quality of education, but I want

408
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:57,050
to make sure that there are enough good school
places for children across the whole country,

409
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,040
and that is what our education consultation
is about.

410
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,480
>>Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):
I came to Prime Minister’s questions today

411
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,960
from an incredibly moving and powerful private
session with the Work and Pensions Committee,

412
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,040
where we talked and listened to victims of
modern slavery who are now living in safe

413
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,120
houses—I do not think I will ever forget
it in my life. Please will the Prime Minister

414
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,580
take her enthusiasm and the passion with which
she drove this issue as Home Secretary and

415
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,800
work with the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions? These people are vulnerable.

416
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,180
When they come to the jobcentre, so often
their background and their cases are not understood.

417
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,820
As with survivors of domestic violence, they
need to be fast-tracked through the system.

418
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,310
If ever vulnerable people needed the state
to step up and support them, it is these people.

419
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,930
Please can we do more?

420
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:51,900
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right. Nothing brings home the absolutely

421
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,290
horrific nature of the crime of modern slavery
than actually sitting down and hearing the

422
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:02,830
testimony of a victim. These people have,
very often, gone through the most horrendous,

423
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:08,090
dehumanising experiences. It is absolutely
right that the Government brought forward

424
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,010
the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It is right that
we have been looking at how victim support

425
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,350
is provided and at the national referral mechanism—a
whole number of steps—and of course we will

426
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:22,790
work with the DWP in looking at the support
that is given. She makes an important point

427
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,280
in referring to jobcentres, but of course
it is not just about jobcentres. One of the

428
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,880
things we need to do is to ensure that those
in authority who come into contact with people

429
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,410
who have been the victims of modern slavery
are able to recognise the signs, and able

430
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,140
to treat it in the right way and deal with
people sensitively and sympathetically in

431
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,380
an appropriate way.

432
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,760
>>Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green):
I do not think the Prime Minister has any

433
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,650
idea of the level of pain that rail passengers
and businesses in Brighton and beyond are

434
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:59,280
suffering. It is not just on strike days;
this has been going on for well over 18 months.

435
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,770
Given the failure of her passive Transport
Secretary, who apparently has no intention

436
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,931
of acting to deal with this utterly incompetent
company, will she sack him, strip GTR of the

437
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:14,980
franchise, and freeze fares for long-suffering
passengers?

438
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:22,550
>>The Prime Minister: First of all, my right
hon. Friend the Transport Secretary has been

439
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:28,460
taking steps in relation to the general performance
of Southern railway. We have stepped in to

440
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:34,100
invest £20 million specifically to tackle
the issue and bring a rapid improvement in

441
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,440
services. We announced Delay Repay 15 from
11 December for the whole of Southern railway,

442
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,580
which will make it easier for passengers to
claim compensation. We have announced that

443
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,600
we will give passengers who are season ticket
holders on Southern a refund for a month’s

444
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,150
travel. We have been looking at the wider
issue. The hon. Lady raises the question of

445
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,653
the current strike. There is only one body
responsible for the current strike, and that

446
00:40:55,653 --> 00:41:01,960
is ASLEF. This a strike by the trade unions,
and she should be standing up and condemning

447
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,410
that strike, because it is passengers who
suffer.

448
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:14,360
>>Sir Hugo Swire (East Devon) (Con): The £1.5
billion of additional funding for the better

449
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,100
care fund is both needed and welcome, but
the problem is that this money is not available

450
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:26,200
until 2019. Will my right hon. Friend therefore
look at seeing whether some of this funding

451
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,650
can be drawn down earlier than that in order
to alleviate the pressure on social care in

452
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,660
areas such as Devon, where there is a very
high level of elderly people?

453
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,000
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
raises an important point about the short-term

454
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,380
pressures on social care. That is why the
Government have been looking at what measures

455
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,150
can be taken to alleviate those short-term
pressures. As I say, my right hon. Friend

456
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,940
the Communities Secretary will be making a
statement on the local government finance

457
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,010
settlement tomorrow, but we do need to look
at the medium-term issues of delivery and

458
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,550
the longer-term reassurance that we can provide
to people in ensuring that we have a sustainable

459
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,420
system of social care that gives people the
comfort of knowing that they will be cared

460
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
for in their old age.

461
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:17,600
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
May I join colleagues who urged people in

462
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,510
this House and beyond to go out and buy the
Jo Cox Foundation single by the excellent

463
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:28,550
MP4, which is not just available on download
but in hard copy for those of us who prefer

464
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,810
that kind of thing?

465
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:37,760
Every day since the Brexit result on 23 June
seems to have been a good day to bury bad

466
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,000
news, and the worst news is in our social
care and health system: the daily wave of

467
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,840
tragedies, indignities and near misses; the
£2.5 billion shortfall in social care funding;

468
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,530
and thousands of operations already cancelled.
Yesterday the Secretary of State for Health

469
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:04,700
said that the NHS and social care needed more
money, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer

470
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,530
did not offer a single extra penny for health
or social care in the autumn statement. Which

471
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,140
of the two does the Prime Minister agree with?
Will she take this opportunity to provide

472
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,130
health and social care with the money it needs
this side of Christmas?

473
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:23,350
>>The Prime Minister: The Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government will

474
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,300
be making a statement tomorrow on the local
government finance settlement. I suggest that

475
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,590
the hon. Gentleman waits for that statement.

476
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:41,350
>>Philip Davies (Shipley) (Con): Back in 2010,
the overseas aid budget was around £7 billion

477
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:48,100
a year. By 2020, it will have more than doubled
to over £15 billion a year. The shortfall

478
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,550
in social care funding by 2020 is estimated
at about £2.5 billion a year. Surely the

479
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,260
Government priority should be to look after
the elderly, vulnerable and disabled people

480
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,030
in our own country before we hand money over
to other countries. Will the Prime Minister

481
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,510
take some of that money—a small amount of
that increase—from the overseas aid budget

482
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,430
and spend it on elderly, vulnerable and disabled
people in our own country? Surely charity

483
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,430
begins at home.

484
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,750
>>The Prime Minister: I think it is absolutely
right that the Government are taking steps

485
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:26,350
on the pressures on social care here in the
United Kingdom, but it is also important for

486
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:32,590
us that we take into consideration those who
are in different circumstances across the

487
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:40,110
world. This Government’s record of ensuring
that 0.7% of our GDP is spent on overseas

488
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,400
aid is a record second to none. We should
all be proud of the help and support that

489
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,190
we are giving to people around the world who,
often, are living in incredibly difficult

490
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:56,030
circumstances. We look after old people here
in the UK; we also take seriously that moral

491
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,380
responsibility for people around the world.
