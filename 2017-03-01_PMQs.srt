1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,060
>>Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire)
(Con): If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,060
for Wednesday 1 March.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,730
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that the whole House will want to

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:14,320
join me in wishing people in the UK, and across
the world, a happy St David’s day. I am

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,570
also sure that the whole House will want to
join me in paying tribute to our former colleague,

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,410
Sir Gerald Kaufman, who died over the weekend.
He was an outstanding parliamentarian and

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,579
a committed MP who dedicated his life to the
service of his constituents. As Father of

8
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:38,050
the House, his wisdom and experience will
be very much missed right across this House.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,300
I am sure that our thoughts are with his friends
and family.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,660
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,719
in this House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

12
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,030
>>Andrew Bridgen: I associate myself with
the Prime Minister’s remarks, and assure

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,600
the many relatives and friends of our former
colleague that they are very much in our thoughts

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
and prayers at this difficult time.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,440
Does my right hon. Friend believe that last
week’s historic by-election victory in Copeland

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:21,320
was an endorsement of her Government’s plans
to maintain a strong economy, bring our society

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,110
together and ensure that we make a huge success
of leaving the European Union?

18
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:32,630
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for his question. First, I wish to congratulate

19
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,869
my hon. Friend, the new Member for Copeland,
and look forward to welcoming her to this

20
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,260
House very shortly. My hon. Friend the Member
for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen)

21
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,369
is absolutely right that last week’s historic
result in Copeland was an endorsement of our

22
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:51,950
plans to keep the economy strong and to ensure
that places such as Copeland share in the

23
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,350
economic success after years of Labour neglect.
It was also an endorsement of our plans to

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:07,090
unite communities where Labour seeks to sow
division and of offering strong, competent

25
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:15,080
leadership in the face of Labour’s chaos.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:25,840
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): May
I join the Prime Minister in wishing everyone

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,450
in Wales, and all Welsh people around the
world, a very happy St David’s day. May

28
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,790
I also express the hope that, today, the workers
at the Ford plant in Bridgend get the assurances

29
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,810
that they need about their job security and
their futures.

30
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,560
I echo the Prime Minister’s tribute to Gerald
Kaufman who served in this House since 1970

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,310
and was the longest serving Member. He started
in political life as an adviser to Harold

32
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,120
Wilson in the 1960s. He was an iconic, irascible
figure in the Labour party and in British

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,590
politics. He was a champion for peace and
justice in the middle east and around the

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,090
world. Yesterday at his funeral, Mr Speaker,
the rabbi who conducted the service conveyed

35
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,860
your message on behalf of the House to his
family, which was very much appreciated. Afterwards,

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,940
I spoke to his family and to his great nephews
and great nieces and asked them how they would

37
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,340
describe Gerald, and they said that he was
an “awesome uncle”. We should remember

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,020
Gerald as that, and convey our condolences
to all of his family.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,310
Just after the last Budget, the then Work
and Pensions Secretary resigned, accusing

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,310
the Government of

41
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,130
“balancing the books on the backs of the
poor and vulnerable.”

42
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:52,430
Last week, the Government sneaked out a decision
to overrule a court decision to extend personal

43
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,160
independence payments to people with severe
mental health conditions. A Government who

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,940
found £1 billion in inheritance tax cuts
to benefit 26,000 families seem unable to

45
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,311
find the money to support 160,000 people with
debilitating mental health conditions. Will

46
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,350
the Prime Minister change her mind?

47
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,150
>>The Prime Minister: Let me be very clear
about what is being proposed in relation to

48
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:26,460
personal independence payments. This is not
a policy change—[Interruption.] This is

49
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,280
not a cut in the amount spent on disability
benefits, and no one is going to see a reduction

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,410
in their benefits from that previously awarded
by the Department for Work and Pensions. What

51
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:49,570
we are doing is restoring the original intention
of the payment agreed by the coalition Government,

52
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,970
and agreed by this Parliament after extensive
consultation.

53
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,350
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Extensive consultation is
an interesting idea, because the court made

54
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:07,090
its decision last year, the Government did
not consult the Social Security Advisory Committee

55
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,900
and, at the last minute, sneaked out their
decision.

56
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,440
The court ruled that the payments should be
made because the people who were to benefit

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,930
from them were suffering “overwhelming psychological
distress”. Just a year ago, the then new

58
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,960
Work and Pensions Secretary said:

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,750
“I can tell the House that we will not be
going ahead with the changes to PIP that had

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
been put forward.”

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,060
The court has since made a ruling. The Prime
Minister’s colleague the hon. Member for

62
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,910
South Cambridgeshire (Heidi Allen) said:

63
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,750
“In my view, the courts are there for a
reason. If they have come up with this ruling,

64
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,810
which says that the criteria should be extended,
then I believe we have a duty to honour that.”

65
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,200
Is she not right?

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,440
>>The Prime Minister: First, on the issue
of these payments and those with mental health

67
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,050
conditions, the personal independence payment
is better for people with mental health conditions.

68
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,050
The figures show that two thirds of people
with mental health conditions who are claiming

69
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,770
personal independence payments and in receipt
of it are awarded the higher daily living

70
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:23,320
rate allowance, compared with less than a
quarter under the previous disability living

71
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
allowance arrangements.

72
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,281
This is the second time that the right hon.
Gentleman has suggested that somehow the change

73
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:43,490
was sneaked out. It was in a written ministerial
statement to Parliament. I might remind him

74
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,960
that week after week he talks to me about
the importance of Parliament; well, we accepted

75
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,840
the importance of Parliament and made the
statement to Parliament. He also referred

76
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,750
to the Social Security Advisory Committee,
and it can look at this matter. My right hon.

77
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,120
Friend the Work and Pensions Secretary called
the Chairman of the SSAC and spoke to him

78
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,730
about the regulations on the day they were
being introduced; he also called the Chairman

79
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,331
of the Select Committee on Work and Pensions
and spoke to him about the regulations that

80
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:20,230
were being introduced; and he called both
offices of the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary,

81
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:36,820
but there was no answer and they did not come
back to him for four days.

82
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,100
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Calling—[Interruption.]
Calling the Chairs of two Committees and making

83
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,910
a written statement to the House does not
add up to scrutiny, and as I understand it

84
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,536
no call was made to the office of my hon.
Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth

85
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:57,850
(Debbie Abrahams), the shadow Secretary of
State.

86
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:06,210
The reality is that this is a shameful decision
that will affect people with dementia, those

87
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,639
suffering cognitive disorders due to a stroke,
military veterans with post-traumatic stress

88
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,330
disorder, and those with schizophrenia. Will
the Prime Minister look at the effects of

89
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,260
her decision to override what an independent
court has decided, and think again?

90
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,160
>>The Prime Minister: The issues and conditions
that the right hon. Gentleman raises are taken

91
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,630
into account when decisions are made about
personal independence payments. The court

92
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,539
said that the regulations were unclear; that
is why we are clarifying the regulations and

93
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:46,240
ensuring that they respect and reflect the
original intention that was agreed by this

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Parliament.

95
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,680
If the right hon. Gentleman wants to talk
about the support being given to people with

96
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,610
disabilities, I say to him that this Government
are spending more than ever in support for

97
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,240
people with disability and health conditions,
and we are spending more than ever on people

98
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,320
with mental health conditions. What we are
doing with personal independence payments

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,430
is ensuring that those who are most in need
get most support.

100
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,090
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Government have overridden
an independent court decision, and they should

101
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,570
think long and hard about that. The Prime
Minister’s hon. Friend, the right hon. Member

102
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,050
for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt),
said this week that the Government have to

103
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,600
“make it very clear that physical and mental
health has the same priority”.

104
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,600
In 2002, the Prime Minister made a speech
to the Conservative party conference. I remember

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,920
it very well; I was watching it on television.
She described her party as the “nasty party”

106
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,090
and said:

107
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,000
“Some Tories have tried to make political
capital by demonising minorities”.

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,460
This week, her policy chair suggested that
people with debilitating conditions were those

109
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
who were

110
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,071
“taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety”

111
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:12,850
and were not “really disabled”. Is that
not proof that the “nasty party” is still

112
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,850
around?

113
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,080
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. Friend
has rightly apologised for the comments that

114
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,000
he made, and I hope that the whole House will
accept his apology. The right hon. Gentleman

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,490
asks me about parity between mental health
conditions and physical conditions. It is

116
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:40,040
this Conservative Government who introduced
parity of esteem in dealing with mental health

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,200
in the national health service. How many years
were Labour in government and did nothing

118
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,620
about it? Thirteen years!

119
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,520
>>Jeremy Corbyn: It was a Labour amendment
to the Health and Social Care Bill that resulted

120
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,440
in parity of esteem being put on the face
of the Bill. I am surprised that the right

121
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,050
hon. Lady has forgotten that; she could have
taken this opportunity to thank the Labour

122
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:15,060
party for putting it forward. The Prime Minister
made a speech earlier this year supporting

123
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,290
parity of esteem for mental health, and I
am glad she did so. However, 40% of NHS mental

124
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:28,350
health trusts are having their budgets cut,
and there are 6,600 fewer mental health nurses

125
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,410
and 160,000 people with severe mental health
conditions who are about to lose out on support.

126
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,490
Can she not recognise that parity of esteem
means funding it properly and not overriding

127
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,490
court decisions that would benefit people
suffering from very difficult conditions?

128
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,430
We should reach out to them, not deny them
the support they need.

129
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:57,620
>>The Prime Minister: As I say, we are spending
more than ever on mental health—£11.4 billion

130
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,120
a year. More people each week are now receiving
treatment in relation to mental health than

131
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,529
previously. Is there more for us to do on
mental health? Yes, there is. I have said

132
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,480
that in this Chamber in answer to questions
that I have received—

133
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,430
>>Emily Thornberry (Islington South and Finsbury)
(Lab): Well, do it!

134
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,279
>>The Prime Minister: The shadow Foreign Secretary
shouts, “Well, do it” from her normal

135
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:26,040
sedentary position—[Interruption.] We are
doing it. That is why we are putting record

136
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,740
amounts of money into mental health. That
is why we are seeing more people being provided

137
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,670
with mental health treatment every week under
this Government. There is one thing that I

138
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,240
know: if we are going to be able to provide
that extra support for people with disabilities

139
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,529
and health conditions and provide treatment
for people with mental health conditions,

140
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:52,700
we need a strong economy that enables us to
pay for it. And the one thing we know about

141
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,450
Labour is that they would bankrupt Britain.

142
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,610
>>Jeremy Corbyn: That is rich, coming from
a Government who, by 2020, will have borrowed

143
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:09,529
more and increased the national debt by the
total borrowing of all Labour Governments.

144
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:13,580
The mental health charity Rethink has said:

145
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,990
“The Government has spoken forcefully about
the importance of parity esteem between physical

146
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,670
and mental health, yet when presented with
the chance to make this a reality...it has

147
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,149
passed on the opportunity”.

148
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,040
As a society, we are judged by how we treat
the most vulnerable. The respected mental

149
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,260
health charity Mind has said:

150
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,899
“This misguided legislation must be reversed”.

151
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:48,839
Will the Prime Minister look again at the
decision of the court and its consequences,

152
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:56,050
withdraw this nasty decision, accept the court’s
judgment and support those who are going through

153
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,360
a very difficult time in their lives? That
is how we will all be judged.

154
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,100
>>The Prime Minister: The way we are dealing
with disability benefits is to ensure that

155
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,620
payments are going to those who are most vulnerable.
What we are doing in relation to personal

156
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,560
independence payments is ensuring that the
agreement of this Parliament is being put

157
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,050
into practice. The right hon. Gentleman talks
about funding and he talks about borrowing.

158
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,120
I understand that today—[Interruption.]

159
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,589
>>Mr Speaker: Order. We cannot have a constant
debate while the Prime Minister is answering

160
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:35,060
the question. The question has been put and
was heard, and the answer must be heard without

161
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,100
a constant hubbub in the background.

162
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,080
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
talks about accepting the court’s decision

163
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,520
and paying for that. When asked how Labour
would pay for the increase if it was put in

164
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,790
place, I understand that the Labour shadow
Health Secretary said today, “Err, we’ve

165
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,180
not outlined that yet.” That just sums up
the Labour party and the Labour party leadership.

166
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:09,399
After the result in Copeland last week, the
hon. Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Cat

167
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,850
Smith) summed up the by-election result by
saying that it was an “incredible result”

168
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:27,860
for the Labour party. I think that word describes
the right hon. Gentleman’s leadership: incredible.

169
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:42,649
>>Stephen Metcalfe (South Basildon and East
Thurrock) (Con): On Monday, I chaired a seminar

170
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,339
at the Royal Society looking at the priorities
for the science community as we start our

171
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,140
Brexit negotiations, and a report of the meeting
will be launched here in Parliament on 21

172
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,850
March. While I of course understand that the
Prime Minister may be too busy to attend,

173
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,850
will she meet me once the report is published
so that I can present to her in person the

174
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,500
collective concerns of the science community,
particularly those around collaboration and

175
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
people?

176
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,461
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising that important issue, which he

177
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:17,120
is right to raise. We want the UK to be the
go-to place for innovators and investors across

178
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,210
the world, and we want to secure the best
possible outcomes for the UK research base

179
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:26,670
as we leave the European Union. Indeed, one
of the objectives that I set out for our negotiations

180
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,110
with the European Union relates to science
and research. We already are a leading destination

181
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,140
for science and innovation, and we would welcome
an agreement to continue to collaborate with

182
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,279
our European partners. I am interested in
what my hon. Friend has said, and I am sure

183
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,971
that that report will be looked at carefully
by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State

184
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,329
for Exiting the European Union.

185
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:49,230
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): We on the
SNP Benches join the Prime Minister and the

186
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,160
leader of the Labour Party in extending our
condolences to the family and friends of Sir

187
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,630
Gerald Kaufman. We also extend our best wishes
to the people of Wales on St David’s Day.

188
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:05,260
In Scottish questions just prior to PMQs today,
Ministers were unable to answer basic questions

189
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,539
about the Government’s plans for agriculture
and for fisheries. Those are important industries

190
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:16,329
for the rural economy and are devolved to
the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament.

191
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,149
With Brexit ending the role of Brussels in
those areas, will all decisions about agriculture

192
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:25,969
and fisheries be made at Holyrood—yes or
no?

193
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,429
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
knows well that we are discussing with the

194
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:38,100
devolved Administrations the whole question
of the UK framework and devolution of issues

195
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,690
as they come back from Brussels. The overriding
aim for everything that we do when we make

196
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,050
those decisions is to ensure that we do not
damage the important single market of the

197
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,660
United Kingdom, a market which I remind the
right hon. Gentleman is more important to

198
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,470
Scotland than the European Union is.

199
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:05,489
>>Angus Robertson: That is a very interesting
answer because people in Scotland, including

200
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:09,751
those working in the agriculture and fisheries
sectors, were told during the Brexit referendum

201
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:14,570
that farming and fisheries powers would be
exercised fully by the Scottish Government

202
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,690
and the Scottish Parliament. Judging by the
Prime Minister’s answer, however, it seems

203
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:28,419
that that will not be true. Will the Prime
Minister confirm today—she has the opportunity—that

204
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:35,970
it is her intention to ensure that UK Ministers
will negotiate and regulate over large areas

205
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,690
that impact on Scottish fisheries and agriculture
post-Brexit?

206
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:46,730
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
seems not to have understood this point, so

207
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,440
I will repeat it. We are in the process of
discussing with the devolved Administrations

208
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,919
the whole question of which of the powers
that currently reside in Brussels will be

209
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,480
returned and will remain at a UK level for
decisions and which powers will be further

210
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,090
devolved to the devolved Administrations.
That is the discussion that is taking place

211
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,659
at the moment. He asks about the Brexit negotiations
with the European Union, and it will be the

212
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:16,480
UK Government that will be negotiating with
the European Union, taking full account of

213
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,830
the interests and concerns of the devolved
Administrations and, indeed, of all the regions

214
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,830
of England.

215
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:31,870
>>Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) (Con): Does
the Prime Minister agree that, when tickets

216
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:38,769
to a teenage cancer charity gig by Ed Sheeran
are being resold on the viagogo ticket website

217
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,640
for more than £1,000, with none of that money
going to the charity, and tickets to the hit

218
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,260
musical “Hamilton” are being touted for
upwards of £5,000 when viagogo knows only

219
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,659
too well that resold tickets are invalid for
entry, it is unfair and not indicative of

220
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:02,059
a market that works for everyone? What will
the Government do to ensure that genuine fans

221
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,820
are not fleeced by ticket touts and rogues?

222
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,860
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising that important issue, which I

223
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,660
know he has been working on for some time.
He is absolutely right to identify circumstances

224
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:23,659
where websites are acting in that way and
causing those problems for people who genuinely

225
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:28,830
believe that they are able to buy tickets
for what they wish to attend. I understand

226
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,750
that he recently met my right hon. Friend
the Minister for Digital and Culture to discuss

227
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,859
the issue. As my hon. Friend will be aware,
the Consumer Rights Act 2015 introduced new

228
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:43,350
rules on ticketing and a review of online
ticket sales. The Department for Culture,

229
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,869
Media and Sport will shortly respond to the
independent report by Professor Michael Waterson

230
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:51,090
on this issue, but as a Government we are
looking at the general issue of where markets

231
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,789
are not working in the interest of consumers.

232
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:59,179
>>Mr Steve Reed (Croydon North) (Lab): I add
my condolences to those already expressed

233
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,600
about the former Father of the House, and
I welcome my new hon. Friend the Member for

234
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:16,639
Stoke-on-Trent Central (Gareth Snell) to his
place. Young black men who use mental health

235
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:20,539
services are more likely than other people
to be subject to detention, extreme forms

236
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:27,580
of medication and severe physical restraint,
and, in extreme cases, this has led to death,

237
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,440
including that of my constituent Seni Lewis.
Too many black people with mental ill health

238
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,760
are afraid to seek treatment from a service
they fear will not treat them fairly. Will

239
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,409
the Prime Minister meet me and some of the
affected families to discuss the need for

240
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:47,919
an inquiry into institutional racism in the
mental health service?

241
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,229
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to welcome
the new hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central

242
00:21:54,229 --> 00:22:03,799
(Gareth Snell) to this House. It is precisely
because of concern about how various people

243
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:13,049
were being treated within our public services
that last year I introduced a racial audit

244
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,331
of the disparity of treatment within public
services. As Home Secretary, I saw this when

245
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:21,820
I looked at the way that people, particularly
black people with mental health issues, were

246
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:29,860
being dealt with by the police and in various
forms of detention. That is exactly the sort

247
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,899
of issue that we are looking at. I am very
happy for the hon. Member for Croydon North

248
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,809
(Mr Reed) to write to me with the details
of the particular issue that he set out.

249
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:42,279
>>Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) (Con): Will
the Prime Minister join me in congratulating

250
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:51,770
my West Suffolk College, all its staff and,
in particular, its principal, Nikos Savvas,

251
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,899
on winning the prestigious teaching and learning
initiative award for the whole country at

252
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:59,429
last week’s Times Educational Supplement
further education awards by combining the

253
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:04,179
teaching of maths, art, religion and science?
I am sure the Prime Minister will agree that

254
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:11,440
that initiative drives forward inquisitive
minds and grows the skills that future generations

255
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,659
will need to succeed.

256
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,789
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to join
my hon. Friend in congratulating West Suffolk

257
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:24,000
College on being given that award for best
teaching and learning initiative for its MARS

258
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,820
initiative. The college has put in place a
really interesting initiative, and I congratulate

259
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:36,869
all its staff. This award is a sign of the
dedication of the staff and students at West

260
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:44,210
Suffolk College. All colleges across the country
should be aspiring to reach these standards,

261
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,149
and she is absolutely right that we need to
ensure that young people have not just a skillset

262
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:54,289
but an inquiring mind that enables them, as
they look forward to what may be different

263
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:58,470
careers throughout their life, to embrace
new skills and change.

264
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:06,279
>>Mary Glindon (North Tyneside) (Lab): My
constituent Joanne Good’s 16-year-old daughter,

265
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:12,880
Megan, tragically died after drinking half
a three-litre bottle of Frosty Jack’s cider,

266
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:22,919
which is 7.5% and, at under £4 a bottle,
contains 22 vodka-shot equivalents. Does the

267
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,229
Prime Minister accept that cheap, super-strength,
white cider is a health hazard and should

268
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:34,440
be banned or at the very least carry a much
higher duty per unit?

269
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,899
>>The Prime Minister: First, I am sure that
Members from across the whole House will want

270
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:46,759
to join me in offering our deepest sympathies
to the family of this 16-year-old constituent—former

271
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:53,350
constituent—of the hon. Lady. She raises
an important issue, which is why the Government

272
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,580
recognise the harm associated with the problem
consumption of alcohol. We have taken action

273
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,470
through the duty system, so that high-strength
ciders and beers are taxed more than equivalent

274
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,859
lower-strength products. We have also, of
course, taken action on the very cheap alcohol

275
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:12,919
by banning sales below duty plus VAT. But
another element is involved, too, which is

276
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,941
making sure that young people are aware of
the dangers and harms of alcohol misuse. Public

277
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:23,299
Health England and the NHS have run campaigns
offering advice and support to young people,

278
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,560
and they also work with charities and in schools
to help to raise that awareness. I think that

279
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,860
is an important part of this.

280
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,889
>>Bob Blackman (Harrow East) (Con): We are
rightly proud that young people can study

281
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:38,730
at our colleges and universities regardless
of race, creed or colour, yet this week Jewish

282
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:45,360
students are being subjected to intimidation,
fear and anti-Semitism as the result of the

283
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,999
so-called Israeli apartheid week. What action
can my right hon. Friend take to make sure

284
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:56,099
that chancellors and principals ensure that
anti-Semitism is not allowed to prosper on

285
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,099
campuses?

286
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:04,460
>>The Prime Minister: First, I want to assure
my hon. Friend that higher education institutions

287
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,210
have a responsibility to ensure that they
provide a safe and inclusive environment for

288
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,320
all students. We expect them to have robust
policies and procedures in place to comply

289
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,820
with the law, and to investigate and swiftly
address hate crime, including any anti-Semitic

290
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,909
incidents that are reported. I know that my
hon. Friend the Minister for Universities,

291
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:28,070
Science, Research and Innovation has recently
written to remind institutions of these expectations,

292
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,919
and he has also urged them to follow the Government’s
lead in adopting the International Holocaust

293
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,669
Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism.

294
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:42,460
>>Roger Mullin (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath)
(SNP): There is a flaw in the legislative

295
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,140
reform order with which the Government are
seeking to create private fund limited partnerships,

296
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,249
which allows criminal-owned Scottish limited
partnerships to convert easily to these new

297
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:59,859
types of partnerships. Will the Prime Minister
step in and delay the LRO until such time

298
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,600
as the current Department for Business, Energy
and Industrial Strategy review on SLPs is

299
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
completed?

300
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,669
>>The Prime Minister: We have taken important
steps to tackle money laundering, terrorist

301
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,769
financing and other economic crimes; I oversaw
the establishment of the economic crime command

302
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:20,989
in the National Crime Agency. On the question
the hon. Gentleman raises on SLPs, I understand

303
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:28,539
that BEIS consulted last year on further transparency
requirements for SLPs and will be publishing

304
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,970
proposals soon, and that my right hon. Friend
the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

305
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,330
Secretary is gathering evidence which may
lead to further reform.

306
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:41,710
>>Andrew Bingham (High Peak) (Con): My right
hon. Friend will be aware of the concerns

307
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,840
about the new business rates. Although there
is a welcome from many of the businesses in

308
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,159
the High Peak that will be taken out of business
rates, there is a concern among those who

309
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,739
have seen an increase—in one case one of
as much as 85%. Can she give me an assurance,

310
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,399
and give those businesses an assurance, that
we will do all we can for these people, who

311
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:04,549
work incredibly hard to be the engine room
of our economy, as a rise of this size may

312
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,690
threaten their livelihoods?

313
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,720
>>The Prime Minister: As my hon. Friend will
know, business rates are based on property

314
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,540
value and it has been seven years since property
values were last looked at, so I think it

315
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,910
is absolutely right that we update them. But
of course, as I recognised last week, there

316
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,490
are different impacts on different businesses,
and it is important that we have already put

317
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,980
significant sums into transitional support
for businesses so that we help the companies

318
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,309
that are facing increased bills. As I said
in this House last week, I have asked my right

319
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,919
hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Communities
and Local Government Secretary to make sure

320
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,330
that the support that is provided is appropriate
and is in place for the hardest cases. I would

321
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,179
expect my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
to say more about this next week in the Budget.

322
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:58,330
>>Sarah Olney (Richmond Park) (LD): A recent
National Audit Office report exposed massive

323
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,549
Government overspend on new free school sites,
and the Department for Education estimates

324
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:08,399
that it will need to spend a further £2.5
billion on land for these schools. Schools

325
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,989
throughout my constituency are reporting chronic
levels of underfunding. Will the Prime Minister

326
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:18,929
please review the plans for new free schools
and provide existing schools with the investment

327
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:19,950
they need?

328
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:25,320
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to say to
the hon. Lady that we have, of course, protected

329
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,820
the core schools budget in real terms. Yes,
we have had free schools—I understand that

330
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:42,009
she raises a concern about them—but we have
seen the programme of free schools and academies

331
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:46,370
continue under this Government to ensure that
we are creating more good school places throughout

332
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,509
the country. That is what we want to do and
that is what our policy will continue to do.

333
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:59,259
>>Glyn Davies (Montgomeryshire) (Con): I join
the Prime Minister in wishing Wales a happy

334
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:06,049
dydd Dewi Sant—St David’s day. The Secretary
of State for Wales has been working with colleagues

335
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:10,259
across Government to send out to the world
the message that Wales is one of the best

336
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:15,860
places in the United Kingdom to live, work,
visit and trade with. Does the Prime Minister

337
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,799
agree that Welsh interests must remain at
the heart of our United Kingdom? As we leave

338
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:26,019
the European Union, the future of the UK Union
has never been more important.

339
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:32,070
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for that question. He is absolutely right

340
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,239
to raise the importance of Wales. My right
hon. Friend the Wales Secretary is doing important

341
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:41,880
work to remind the world that Wales is one
of the best places in the UK to live, work

342
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,029
and trade with. In the forthcoming negotiations
we are committed to getting a deal that works

343
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,139
for all parts of the UK, including Wales.
The best way to achieve that is for the UK

344
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:56,769
Government and the devolved Administrations
to continue to work together. I am pleased

345
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:59,889
to say that I am going to be hosting a St
David’s day reception in Downing Street

346
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:08,440
tonight to celebrate everything that Wales
has to offer. I once again wish all Members

347
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,059
of this House dydd Gŵyl Dewi hapus.

348
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:21,510
>>Judith Cummins (Bradford South) (Lab): Congestion,
journey times and connectivity between Bradford

349
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,120
and Leeds are among the worst in the country.
Will the Prime Minister support the campaign

350
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,929
to ensure that Bradford is part of the High
Speed 3 network? Will she commit to delivering

351
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,929
the investments we so desperately need for
our West Yorkshire powerhouse?

352
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:41,399
>>The Prime Minister: I apologise to the hon.
Lady, but I missed the first part of her question.

353
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,230
I think she was talking about investment in
infrastructure in her area. [Interruption.]

354
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,619
HS3, right. The Government have obviously
already set out the commitments we have made

355
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:57,259
on infrastructure. As she will know, we believe
infrastructure plays an important part in

356
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:03,719
encouraging the growth of the economy and
ensuring that we see increased productivity

357
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:07,889
around the rest of the country. Over time,
we will of course be looking at further projects

358
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:09,710
that can do just that.

359
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,529
>>Victoria Prentis (Banbury) (Con): When I
was canvassing in Copeland recently, people

360
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:24,330
there wanted to talk about the future of their
local maternity unit; it was just like being

361
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:32,080
at home in Banbury. Rather than politicise
the NHS, would the Prime Minister agree to

362
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:40,279
a review of maternity services, encouraging
care that is not just safe but kind and close

363
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,610
to home?

364
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:49,960
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend makes
an important point about local maternity services.

365
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,229
As I have said, I am looking forward to welcoming
the new Member for Copeland to this House

366
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:58,149
very shortly. During the recent campaign,
she made it very clear that she did not want

367
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:04,820
to see any downgrading of the West Cumberland
hospital services. She also did something

368
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,684
else. She put forward a powerful case for
what my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury

369
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:14,589
(Victoria Prentis) has just suggested: a review
to tackle the recruitment issues that affect

370
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:19,700
the maternity services up there. A professionally
led review seems very sensible, and I know

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,830
that the Health Minister is looking into it.

372
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,479
>>Alex Cunningham (Stockton North) (Lab):
A 19-year-old constituent of mine faces being

373
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:32,190
discharged by the Tees, Esk and Wear Valley
mental health trust for a second time because

374
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,019
the trust has neither the skills nor the cash
to provide the support he needs. What is the

375
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,409
Prime Minister’s message to him?

376
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:42,340
>>The Prime Minister: I am sorry, but I obviously
do not know the full details of the individual

377
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,049
case raised by the hon. Gentleman. We are
ensuring that more money is being—and will

378
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,509
continue to be—put into mental health conditions
over the year. I am sure that the Secretary

379
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,740
of State for Health will look into that case,
if the hon. Gentleman wants to write to him

380
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,080
about it.

381
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,999
>>Andrew Selous (South West Bedfordshire)
(Con): As a leader who wants to spread wealth

382
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:10,040
and opportunity as widely as possible, will
the Prime Minister ensure that we end the

383
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,130
practice of developers buying freehold land
on which they then sell new houses on a leasehold

384
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:22,890
basis? Many first time buyers on Help to Buy
feel that they are being ripped off by this

385
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,119
practice and look to the Government for help.

386
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,010
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for mentioning that issue, which he has raised

387
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,560
with me previously. I know he is concerned
about it and working on it. Our housing White

388
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,000
Paper clearly sets out that developers should
be building homes for people to live in. That

389
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,851
means that we will act to promote fairness
for the growing number of leaseholders, but

390
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:50,850
we will consult on a range of measures to
tackle unfair and unreasonable abuses of leasehold,

391
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:56,850
as the Housing Minister has said. Other than
in certain exceptional circumstances, I do

392
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,340
not see why new homes should not be built
and sold with the freehold interest at the

393
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
point of sale.

394
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,250
>>Sir Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) (Lab):
May I add my condolences to the family of

395
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:12,830
Gerald Kaufman, who was one of my friends
in this place? I received an email yesterday

396
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:19,011
from a local pharmacist who, since the Government
announcement in October last year, has had

397
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:24,400
to implement cost-cutting measures, including
to staff and services. This week he received

398
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,390
a notification of the payment for prescriptions
dispensed in December last year, and has had

399
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,310
a reduction of nearly £9,000, which represents
an 18.8% cut—well beyond the 4% that the

400
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,010
Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon.
Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)—the

401
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,210
pharmacies Minister—spoke about in October.
Will the Government commit to revisit community

402
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,530
pharmacy funding as a matter of urgency?

403
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,080
>>The Prime Minister: We all recognise the
important service that pharmacies provide,

404
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,820
which is why spending on them has actually
risen in recent years. There has been an increase

405
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,470
of more than 18% in the number of pharmacies
over the past decade. The system needs to

406
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:08,520
reform so that NHS resources are spent efficiently
and effectively. Let us look at some of the

407
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,360
figures: two fifths of pharmacies are within
10 minutes’ walk of two or more other pharmacies;

408
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,780
the average pharmacy receives roughly £220,000
a year in NHS funding; and most pharmacies

409
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:27,400
receive the £25,000 establishment payment,
regardless of size or quality. We looked at

410
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,080
this concern when it was raised last summer,
and made changes to ensure that greater support

411
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,910
was available to pharmacies in particular
areas.

412
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:42,520
>>Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con): One
of David Cameron’s greatest legacies was

413
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:49,070
his effort to fight human trafficking under
the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Last year, this

414
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:56,630
country looked after 800,000 children in Syria
or the surrounding countries for the same

415
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:03,800
investment as looking after 3,000 in this
country. By doing that, we help to defeat

416
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,510
human trafficking. Will the Prime Minister
confirm that we will continue with that policy?

417
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,050
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to join
my hon. Friend in paying tribute to David

418
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,910
Cameron. I was pleased that he supported the
Modern Slavery Act when I proposed introducing

419
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:24,910
it. We are, indeed, committed to continuing
our policy in this area. I have set up, and

420
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:30,300
chair, a modern slavery taskforce at No. 10,
bringing together various parties to ensure

421
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,211
that we are doing what is necessary across
Government to break the criminal gangs, deal

422
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,780
with the perpetrators and provide the necessary
support for victims.

423
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,210
>>Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP): May
I, on behalf of my hon. and right hon. Friends,

424
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,820
join the Prime Minister and the Leader of
the Opposition in expressing condolences to

425
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:56,000
the family of the late Father of the House?
He will be greatly missed. The Prime Minister

426
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:07,490
cannot fail to have noticed the recent intervention
in the Brexit debate by two former Prime Ministers;

427
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:14,240
I am sure they were very helpful. I am sure
that she will know what they and everybody

428
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,350
else mean by “hard Brexit” and by “soft
Brexit”, but we are all now wondering what

429
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:31,270
is meant by a “soft coup”, when 
it might be triggered, and when, indeed, we

430
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:37,460
will know whether it has been triggered. Perhaps
the Prime Minister will elucidate on that

431
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,700
since she has been so helpful in many other
ways. Will she take the opportunity today,

432
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,270
however, to make it clear that, whatever former
Prime Ministers or Members of the unelected

433
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:54,780
upper House may say, the reality is that her
plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March

434
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,120
is now clearly on track?

435
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:04,740
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that question. It is, indeed,

436
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,410
my plan to trigger by the end of March, and
when I refer to that, I refer, of course,

437
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,480
to the triggering of article 50, rather than
attempting to trigger any coup, soft or otherwise,

438
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,880
that might take place. It is still our intention
to do that. It is important; the article 50

439
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,990
Bill, of course, does respond to the judgment
of the Supreme Court, but it also ensures

440
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,490
that we are responding to the voice of the
United Kingdom, when people voted to ensure

441
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,570
that we do leave the European Union, and that
is what we will do.

442
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:36,940
>>Rebecca Pow (Taunton Deane) (Con): Mr Speaker,
perhaps you, like many other hon. Members

443
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:54,250
here today, took a shower this morning—[Laughter.]
I am sure you were very careful to check whether

444
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,670
the shower gel contained microbeads. [Hon.
Members: “Ah!”]

445
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:10,250
>>Mr Speaker: Order. We must hear the thrust
of this fascinating question. Mrs Pow, let’s

446
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,900
hear it.

447
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,340
>>Rebecca Pow: Shower gel products containing
microbeads can result in 100,000 microbeads

448
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:23,110
or microplastics being washed down the drain
every time we use them—into the water system,

449
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,970
and then into the marine environment, damaging
these precious habitats. Would the Prime Minister

450
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:34,040
join me in welcoming the steps this Government
are taking to introduce a ban on microbeads

451
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:45,580
used in cosmetics and personal care products,
with the consultation ending just a few days

452
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,950
ago?

453
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:58,270
>>The Prime Minister: I think I should say
for clarity to Members of this House that

454
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:08,970
I am not in a position to know whether or
not you took a shower this morning, Mr Speaker.

455
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:17,450
My hon. Friend has raised a very important
point. It is completely unnecessary to add

456
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,860
plastics to products like face washes and
body scrub, where harmless alternatives can

457
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,050
be used. As she said at the end of her question,
our consultation to ban microbeads in cosmetics

458
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,670
and personal care products closed recently.
We are aiming to change legislation by October

459
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,170
2017, and we also ask for evidence of what
more can be done in future to prevent other

460
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,970
sources of plastic from entering the marine
environment, because we are committed to being

461
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:47,820
the first generation ever to leave the environment
in a better state than when it was inherited.

462
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,600
I am sure that, together, we can all work
to bring an end to these harmful plastics

463
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,920
clogging up our oceans.

464
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,370
>>Mr Speaker: I think both Philip and Sally
are very reassured by what the Prime Minister

465
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,890
has just said.

466
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:06,530
>>Mrs Madeleine Moon (Bridgend) (Lab): Along
the M4 corridor in south Wales, over 1,000

467
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:13,780
families woke up this morning deeply worried
about potential job losses at Ford in Bridgend.

468
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,530
Families in Ogmore and Bridgend are particularly
frightened—frightened that Ford is not going

469
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:26,470
to be able to bring new contracts into the
factory, with the uncertainty of Brexit ahead.

470
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:32,760
Can I have an assurance from the Prime Minister
that she will arrange for her Ministers to

471
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,120
meet Ford and Unite the union to see what
can be done to support Ford to ensure continuity

472
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,510
of engine production in the Bridgend plant?

473
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,940
>>The Prime Minister: Can I reassure the hon.
Lady that our automotive sector is one of

474
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,740
the most productive in the world? We want
to see it going from strength to strength.

475
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,300
That is why Ministers in this Government have
been engaging with various companies within

476
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,590
the automotive sector, including Ford and
other companies. Ford is an important investor

477
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,100
here; it has been established here for over
100 years. We now account for around a third

478
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,520
of Ford’s global engine production, and
Bridgend continues to be an important part

479
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,310
of that. We have had, as I said, dialogue
with Ford; we will continue to have a regular

480
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,170
dialogue with Ford about the ways in which
Government can help to make sure that this

481
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,790
success continues.
