1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,910
>> Danny Kinahan (South Antrim) (UUP):
If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,460
for Wednesday 29 March.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,920
>> The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May)
I would like to update the House on last week’s

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,490
terrorist attack. Since my statement on Thursday,
the names of those who died have been released.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,020
They were Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie
Rhodes and, of course, PC Keith Palmer. I

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,240
am sure that Members of all parties will join
me in offering our deepest condolences to

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,499
their friends and families. The police and
security services’ investigation continues;

8
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:39,440
two people have been arrested and remain in
custody.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,100
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others, and in addition to

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,280
my duties in this House, I shall have further
such meetings later today.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,039
>> Danny Kinahan:
I echo those sentiments and congratulate the

12
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,079
Prime Minister on all the good work done last
week and since that time.

13
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,489
I also congratulate the Prime Minister and
the Government on triggering article 50 today.

14
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:06,980
I know that this is a momentous action for
the whole of the United Kingdom. Although

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:13,260
I, in common with the right hon. Lady, campaigned
to stay in, we recognise that the people have

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,320
spoken, and we offer the Ulster Unionist party’s
full support in ensuring that the negotiations

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,490
deliver the best for the whole of the United
Kingdom, and particularly for Northern Ireland.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,630
I ask the Prime Minister to confirm that,
in the extremely improbable event that a border

19
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,540
poll should take place regarding the future
of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,240
during her premiership, her Government would
fully support any official remain campaign,

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:56,930
just as the Government have done in regard
of the EU and indeed Scotland.

22
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,600
>> The Prime Minister:
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,570
today we give effect to the democratic decision
of the people of the United Kingdom, who voted

24
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:14,780
for us to leave the European Union. It was
a call to make the United Kingdom a country

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,591
that works for everyone, not just the privileged
few. We are, of course, fully committed within

26
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,939
that to ensuring that the unique interests
of Northern Ireland are protected and advanced

27
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,470
as we establish our negotiating position.
Our position has always been clear—that

28
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,739
we strongly support the Belfast agreement,
including the principle of consent that Northern

29
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,409
Ireland’s constitutional position is a matter
for the people of Northern Ireland to determine.

30
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,230
As our manifesto made clear, we have a preference
for Northern Ireland to remain part of the

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:52,290
United Kingdom, and we will never be neutral
in expressing our support for that, because

32
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,840
I believe fundamentally in the strength of
our Union.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,379
>> Mr Ranil Jayawardena (North East Hampshire)
(Con):

34
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,469
Pupils and parents deserve good schools and
real choice in education, including schools

35
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:10,060
that are focused unashamedly on academic rigour.
Will my right hon. Friend tell us when the

36
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,110
Government will open applications for the
new wave of free schools, and will she confirm

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,310
that they will be genuinely free to be run
as they wish, serving the local community

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,579
and creating schools that work for everyone?

39
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,209
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I believe

40
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,730
that schools should be free to be run as best
suits them. We are putting autonomy and freedom

41
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,360
in the hands of strong leaders and outstanding
teachers so that they can deliver an excellent

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,431
education. We want to get out of the way of
outstanding education providers so that they

43
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:45,390
can set up the types of schools that parents
want. That is why we have set out our new

44
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,779
plans to remove the ban on new grammar schools
and the restrictions on new faith schools.

45
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:56,169
It is a complex area, but we expect to announce
the detail of the next wave of free school

46
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,680
applications following the publication of
our schools White Paper.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,779
>> Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab):
I want to begin by paying tribute, as the

48
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,129
Prime Minister did, to the emergency services
across the country, and especially to all

49
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,459
those who responded to the Westminster attack
last Wednesday and those who turned out to

50
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,190
help the victims of the New Ferry explosion
last Saturday. Our thoughts remain with the

51
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,770
injured and those who have lost loved ones,
and we especially thank the police for their

52
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,810
ongoing investigations. Will the Prime Minister
assure us that the police will be given all

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,310
the necessary support and resources to take
them through this very difficult period of

54
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,320
investigating what happened last Wednesday?

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,970
>> The Prime Minister:
I join the right hon. Gentleman in praising

56
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,240
the work of our emergency services, who, as
he has pointed out, have to deal with a wide

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,400
range of incidents. Our focus in the House
has most recently been on the attack that

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,990
took place last Wednesday, but we should never
forget that, day in and day out, our emergency

59
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,730
services are working on our behalf and often
putting themselves in danger as a result of

60
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,890
the work that they do.

61
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,570
I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that
I have, of course, been keeping in touch with

62
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,990
both the security services and the Metropolitan
police—as has my right hon. Friend the Home

63
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,330
Secretary—about the current investigation
of the attack last week, and about future

64
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,530
security arrangements. I can also assure him
that they have the resources that they need

65
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,349
in order to carry out their vital work.

66
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:26,131
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Of course we all pay tribute to the police

67
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:32,840
for the work that they do, but there are some
problems. Between 2015 and 2018 there will

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,000
be a real-terms cut of £330 million in central
Government funding for police forces. Can

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,810
the Prime Minister assure the House that police
forces all over the country have the necessary

70
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,100
resources with which to do the job?

71
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,900
>> The Prime Minister:
I remind the right hon. Gentleman that we

72
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,550
have protected the police budget in the comprehensive
spending review. I also remind him that the

73
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,470
former shadow Home Secretary, his colleague
the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham),

74
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,240
said during the 2015 Labour party conference
that

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
“savings can be found. The Police say 5
per cent to 10 per cent over the Parliament

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,610
is just about do-able.”

77
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,861
We did not accept that. We have actually protected
the police budget. I have been speaking to

78
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:19,050
police forces, as has my right hon. Friend
the Home Secretary, and they are very clear

79
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,820
about the fact that they have the resources
that they need for the work that they are

80
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
doing.

81
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,440
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
A survey undertaken recently by the Police

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:35,300
Federation reveals that 55% of serving police
officers say that their morale is low because

83
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:43,660
of how their funding has been treated. Frontline
policing is vital to tackling crime and terrorism,

84
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,040
but there are 20,000 fewer police officers
and 12,000 fewer officers on the frontline

85
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,360
than there were in 2010. I ask the Prime Minister
again: will she think again about the cuts

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,051
in policing, and will she guarantee that policing
on the frontline will be protected so that

87
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:05,730
every community can be assured that it has
the police officers it needs?

88
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,550
>> The Prime Minister:
As I said to the right hon. Gentleman, we

89
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:15,740
have protected police budgets, including the
precept that the police are able to raise

90
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,530
locally. But let us just think about what
has happened since 2010. Since then, crimes

91
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,140
that are traditionally measured by the independent
crime survey have fallen by a third, to a

92
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:35,940
record low. That is due to the work of hard-working
police officers up and down the country, and

93
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,480
they have been backed by this Government.
Yes, we have made them more accountable through

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,430
directly elected police and crime commissioners,
and yes, there has been reform of policing—including

95
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,940
reform of the Police Federation, which was
very necessary—but we have ensured that

96
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,840
they have the resources to do their job, and
we now see crime at a record low.

97
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
>> Victoria Atkins (Louth and Horncastle)
(Con):

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:06,670
The Royal Air Force is preparing to fly Typhoons
from RAF Coningsby in my constituency to Romania

99
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:13,270
to support our NATO allies on the border with
Russia. That is happening as President Putin

100
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,020
is locking up his political opponents and
crushing calls for democracy. Will my right

101
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,920
hon. Friend confirm that, as we leave the
European Union, the United Kingdom will continue

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,910
to lead NATO in defending that vital border,
and will she pay tribute to the members of

103
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,560
the armed forces who safeguard our democracy
at home and abroad?

104
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,668
>> The Prime Minister:
I am very happy to join my hon. Friend in

105
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,440
paying tribute to the men and women of our
armed forces. They are the best in the world.

106
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,890
They work tirelessly to keep us safe, and
we owe them every gratitude for doing so.

107
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,700
I can also assure her that our commitment
to collective defence and security through

108
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,330
NATO is as strong as ever. We will meet our
NATO pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence

109
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,810
in every year of this decade, and we plan
to spend £178 billion on the equipment plan

110
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,810
to 2025.

111
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,640
My hon. Friend referred to the work being
done by the Royal Air Force in relation to

112
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,020
Romania. With NATO, we are deploying a battalion
to Estonia and a reconnaissance squadron to

113
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,700
Poland, and I think that shows our very clear
commitment to our collective security and

114
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,700
defence.

115
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,540
>> Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):
We associate ourselves with the condolences

116
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,200
given by the Prime Minister and the leader
of the Labour party and their praise for the

117
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,800
emergency and security services during and
in the wake of the appalling terrorist atrocity

118
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,950
last week.

119
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,610
Last year, the Prime Minister promised that
before she triggered article 50 on leaving

120
00:09:51,610 --> 00:10:01,080
the European Union she would secure a UK-wide
approach—an agreement—with the Governments

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:08,320
of—[Interruption.] Last year, the Prime
Minister did make that promise: she promised

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,960
that there would be an agreement with the
Governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern

123
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:20,000
Ireland before she triggered article 50. The
Prime Minister has now triggered article 50,

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,120
and she has done so without an agreement;
there is no agreement. Why has she broken

125
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,110
her promise and broken her word?

126
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:37,420
>> The Prime Minister:
I have been very clear throughout, since the

127
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,380
first visit that I made as Prime Minister
to Edinburgh last July, that we were going

128
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,600
to work with the devolved Administrations
and that we would develop a UK-wide approach,

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,760
but that it would be a UK approach that was
taken into the negotiations and that it would

130
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,110
be the United Kingdom Government who took
forward that position—and I would simply

131
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,399
remind the right hon. Gentleman that Scotland
is part of the United Kingdom.

132
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,910
>> Angus Robertson:
People viewing will note that the Prime Minister

133
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,860
did not deny that she said she would seek
a UK-wide approach and agreement with the

134
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,610
Governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and there is no agreement.

135
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,110
The Scottish Government were elected with
a higher percentage of the vote—a bigger

136
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:36,250
electoral mandate—than the UK Government.
Yesterday the Scottish Parliament voted by

137
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:44,220
69 to 59 that people in Scotland should have
a choice about their future. After the negotiations

138
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,220
on the European Union are concluded, there
will be a period for democratic approval of

139
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,550
the outcome. That choice will be exercised
in this Parliament, in the European Parliament

140
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:03,570
and in 27 member states of the European Union.
Given that everybody else will have a choice

141
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:14,290
at that time, will the people of Scotland
have a choice about their future?

142
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,460
>> The Prime Minister:
I say to the right hon. Gentleman that we

143
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:26,740
are taking forward the views of the United
Kingdom into the negotiations with the European

144
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:33,370
Union on the United Kingdom exiting the European
Union. The Scottish nationalist party consistently

145
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,000
talks—[Hon. Members: “National.”]

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,010
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. Ms Cherry, this is very unseemly heckling.

147
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,550
You are a distinguished QC; you would not
behave like that in the Scottish courts—you

148
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,870
would be chucked out.

149
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:58,240
The Prime Minister:
The SNP consistently talks about independence

150
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,100
as the only subject it wishes to talk about.
What I say to the right hon. Gentleman and

151
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:13,560
his colleagues is this: now is not the time
to be talking about a second independence

152
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:22,450
referendum. On today of all days we should
be coming together as a United Kingdom to

153
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,529
get the best deal for Britain.

154
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,930
>> Julian Sturdy (York Outer) (Con):
Improving vocational and technical education

155
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,970
is vital in closing our productivity gap,
so can the Prime Minister assure me that vocational

156
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,160
education will enjoy equal status with academic
education, so that as we leave the EU our

157
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,040
young people can be equipped to build the
high-skilled economy of the future?

158
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,990
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend raises a very important issue.

159
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,110
It is essential for young people that we give
vocational and technical education the right

160
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,300
esteem and focus, because that is essential
in addressing our productivity gap. We want

161
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,459
to deliver a world-leading technical education
system and create two genuine options for

162
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:17,250
young people that are equal in esteem. At
the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor

163
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,180
announced a significant package of investment
to implement the most ambitious post-16 reforms

164
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,140
since the introduction of A-levels 70 years
ago. We are going to be investing an extra

165
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,209
half a billion pounds a year in England’s
technical education system and introducing

166
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:37,330
maintenance loans to support those studying
high-level technical qualifications at prestigious

167
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,560
institutes of technology and national colleges.

168
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,701
>> Bill Esterson (Sefton Central) (Lab):
The Treasury Committee says that for many

169
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:51,800
small companies, having to fill in a tax return
every three months will mean facing disaster,

170
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,470
and the Federation of Small Businesses says
that the extra annual cost is likely to be

171
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:06,300
at least £2,700 a year—yet another burden
on business from this Government. The Prime

172
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:13,990
Minister got it wrong on national insurance;
is she going to backtrack on tax returns as

173
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,990
well?

174
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,610
>> The Prime Minister:
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should have listened

175
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,649
to the announcement that my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor made in the Budget, when he

176
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:25,130
indicated that he would delay the introduction
of the change for a year for the smallest

177
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:31,790
businesses below the VAT threshold. It is
right that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs

178
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:39,300
tries to move to a greater digitisation of
how it operates, enabling it to provide a

179
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,800
better service to those who are completing
their forms. We should always remember that

180
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,149
aspect of what is being proposed.

181
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,270
>> David Mackintosh (Northampton South) (Con):
I welcome the additional money that the Government

182
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,970
have given for adult social care, but it is
important that we also look at long-term solutions.

183
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,700
As part of the long-term review, will the
Prime Minister look at some of the cases in

184
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,720
my constituency, and at the issues with how
the system works for Northamptonshire County

185
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,800
Council and Northampton general hospital?

186
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,600
>> The Prime Minister:
I am grateful for my hon. Friend’s welcome

187
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,980
for the extra money—the £2 billion that
was announced by my right hon. Friend the

188
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,959
Chancellor in the Budget—that is going into
social care. That shows that we have recognised

189
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,440
the pressures and demands on social care,
but it is also important that we ensure that

190
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,899
best practice is delivered across the whole
country. It is not just about money, so we

191
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,930
are also trying to find a long-term, sustainable
solution that will help local authorities

192
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,230
to learn from each other to raise standards
across the whole system. We will bring forward

193
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,480
proposals in a Green Paper later this year
to put the state-funded system on a more secure

194
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,420
and sustainable footing.

195
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,740
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
As Home Secretary, the Prime Minister clearly

196
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,130
did not protect police budgets. Last week,
she told me four times:

197
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,910
“We have protected the schools budget.”—[Official
Report, 22 March 2017; Vol. 623, c. 854-855.]

198
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,570
Does she still stand by that statement?

199
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,510
>> The Prime Minister:
We have protected schools’ budgets, and

200
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,730
we are putting record funding into schools.

201
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,920
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
Today, the Public Accounts Committee says

202
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,209
of the Department for Education:

203
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:23,000
“The Department does not seem to understand
the pressures that schools are already under.”

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,240
It goes on to say that “Funding per pupil
is reducing in real terms”,

205
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:39,140
and that school budgets will be cut by £3
billion—equivalent to 8%—by 2020. Is the

206
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,540
Public Accounts Committee wrong?

207
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,179
>> The Prime Minister:
What we will see over the course of this Parliament

208
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:54,309
is £230 billion going into our schools, but
what matters is the quality of education in

209
00:17:54,309 --> 00:18:01,050
schools. An additional 1.8 million children
are in good or outstanding schools, and this

210
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,009
Government’s policy is to ensure that every
child gets a good school place.

211
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,591
>> Jeremy Corbyn:
The daily experience of many parents who have

212
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:18,800
children in school is that they receive letters
asking for money. One parent, Elizabeth, wrote

213
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,080
to me to say that she has received a letter
from her daughter’s school asking for a

214
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,250
monthly donation to top up the reduced funds
that it is receiving. This Government’s

215
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,921
cuts to schools are betraying a generation
of our children. If the Prime Minister is

216
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:40,070
right, the parents are wrong, the teachers
are wrong, the Institute for Fiscal Studies

217
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,170
is wrong, the National Audit Office is wrong,
and the Education Policy Institute is wrong.

218
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:51,930
Now the Public Accounts Committee, which includes
eight Conservative Members, is also wrong.

219
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:58,100
Which organisation does back the Prime Minister’s
view on education spending in our schools?

220
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,610
>> The Prime Minister:
As I have just said to the right hon. Gentleman,

221
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,210
we said that we would protect school funding,
and we have; there is a real-terms protection

222
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,800
for the schools budget. We said that we would
protect the money following children into

223
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,540
schools, and we have; the schools budget reaches
£42 billion, as pupil numbers rise, in 2019-20.

224
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,000
But I also have to say to him that it is about
the quality of education that children are

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,430
receiving, with 1.8 million more children
in good or outstanding schools than there

226
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,750
were under the Labour Government.

227
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,970
Time and again, the right hon. Gentleman stands
up at Prime Minister’s questions and asks

228
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,760
questions that would lead to more spending.
Let us look at what he has said recently:

229
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:48,140
on 11 January, more spending; on 8 February,
more spending; on 22 February, more spending;

230
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:56,990
on 1 and 8 March, more spending; and on 15
and 22 March, more spending. Barely a PMQs

231
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:04,419
goes by that he does not call for more public
spending. When it comes to spending money

232
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:10,280
that it does not have, Labour simply cannot
help itself. It is the same old Labour: spend

233
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:21,640
today and give somebody else the bill tomorrow.
Well, we will not do that to the next generation.

234
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,790
>> Bill Wiggin (North Herefordshire) (Con):
If she will introduce an award in recognition

235
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,629
of the contribution made by munitions workers
in the first and second world wars.

236
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,880
>> The Prime Minister:
I am sure everyone in the House will want

237
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,910
to join me in paying tribute to the thousands
who worked in munitions factories in both

238
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,340
world wars, often in very dangerous conditions.
They produced vital equipment for the armed

239
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,080
forces that helped us to victory. I am sure
my hon. Friend will recognise that, for practical

240
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,580
reasons, it is not possible to pursue individual
awards, but the Department for Business, Energy

241
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,350
and Industrial Strategy would be happy to
work with him to look at further ways of recognising

242
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,490
the collective effort of former munitions
workers.

243
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,460
>> Bill Wiggin:
I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer.

244
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,610
These ladies found that the chemicals in the
shells turned their skin yellow, and they

245
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,180
were nicknamed canary girls. I know my right
hon. Friend is exceptionally busy at the moment,

246
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,540
but could she find just a few moments in her
diary to meet me and some of these canary

247
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,240
girls to recognise their service?

248
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,370
>> The Prime Minister:
I would be very happy to meet some canary

249
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:30,929
girls. As I said, their work was vital to
the war effort. Their work was, in one sense,

250
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,010
absolutely routine, but in another sense,
it was extremely dangerous, and we should

251
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,350
recognise their efforts.

252
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,510
>> Carolyn Harris (Swansea East) (Lab):
The Prime Minister will be aware that the

253
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,970
Welsh Labour Government have established a
children’s funeral fund. Many independent

254
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,010
and leading funeral providers, such as The
Co-operative and Dignity, have also indicated

255
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,780
that there will be no charges for children’s
and young people’s funerals. I know that

256
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,460
she is a compassionate woman, and I know that
she understands the importance of a children’s

257
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,760
funeral fund, so will she agree to work with
me to further establish this fund, to bring

258
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,840
some comfort to bereaved parents in their
darkest hour?

259
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,669
>> The Prime Minister:
I pay tribute to the hon. Lady, who has campaigned

260
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:24,460
tirelessly on this issue. Obviously, she is
not just a passionate campaigner, but has

261
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,290
on many occasions spoken movingly in this
House about her own experience, which she

262
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,880
is bringing to bear on this issue. I welcome
the decision that has been taken by the Co-op

263
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,280
to waive funeral fees, and I recognise the
actions of the Welsh Government. Of course

264
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,210
there is some financial support available,
but we are looking at the issue and the problems

265
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,910
faced by parents. We are looking at what more
can be done through cross-Government work,

266
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,480
and I will ask the Minister for the Cabinet
Office, who is leading on that work, to meet

267
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,429
with her to talk about the idea.

268
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,120
>> David T. C. Davies (Monmouth) (Con):
As the Prime Minister will know, the Budget

269
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,890
gave an extra £200 million to the Welsh Labour
Government in order to provide business rates

270
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,440
relief. Does she agree with me and the leader
of Monmouthshire County Council, Peter Fox

271
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,460
OBE, that Welsh Labour must now commit to
spending that money on supporting Welsh businesses

272
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,100
and giving them the same level of support
that is being provided in England by this

273
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,920
Conservative Government?

274
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,450
>> The Prime Minister:
My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As he

275
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:28,179
says, at the Budget, my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor announced a £200 million boost

276
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,960
for the Welsh Government’s budget. They
will be able to use that money to support

277
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,100
their own priorities, but the people of Wales
will be able to send a very clear signal about

278
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,191
those priorities by voting for Conservative
councillors, like Peter Fox, on 4 May. It

279
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:47,130
is the UK Government’s actions to support
ordinary working families throughout the country

280
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,810
that will ensure that Wales benefits from
an economy that works for everyone.

281
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:57,429
>> Tulip Siddiq (Hampstead and Kilburn) (Lab):
During the EU referendum campaign, the now

282
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:02,410
Foreign Secretary urged people to“take back
control of huge sums of money”—£350 million

283
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:14,790
a week—“and spend it on our priorities”,Such
as the NHS. The Prime Minister will trigger

284
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,600
article 50 today. Can she confirm precisely
when she wants to fulfil the promise made

285
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,169
by her Cabinet colleague, who is sitting on
the Front Bench and smirking at the British

286
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,169
public?

287
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:30,620
>> The Prime Minister:
I am very happy—[Interruption.]

288
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:41,790
>> Mr Speaker:
Order. Boris is sitting perfectly comfortably,

289
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,010
and there is an air of repose about the fellow,
to which we are accustomed. Let us hear from

290
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,010
the Prime Minister.

291
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,650
>> The Prime Minister:
I am very happy to tell the hon. Lady that,

292
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,710
of course, when this country leaves the European
Union, we will have control of our budgets

293
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,460
and we will decide how that money is spent.

294
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,970
>> William Wragg (Hazel Grove) (Con):
With modification, schools in my constituency

295
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,890
welcome the national funding formula. Given
the Leader of the Opposition’s contribution,

296
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,320
I hope that the next part of my question does
not land me on the naughty step. Given that

297
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,560
Stockport schools and other f40 schools have
been at the bottom of the funding pile for

298
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,820
years and therefore have less scope for efficiencies,
will my right hon. Friend consider providing

299
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,071
more immediate support to them?

300
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:36,210
>> The Prime Minister:
As my hon. Friend is saying, we are aiming

301
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:41,680
to end the postcode lottery of schools funding,
and as I said, schools funding is now at a

302
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,382
record high. On the minimum funding level,
as I have said before, the Department for

303
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:53,100
Education has heard representations on the
issue on this national funding formula and

304
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,330
will, of course, be considering those. This
was a consultation, and there have been a

305
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:02,240
lot of responses to it, but it is an historic
and complex reform. There has been general

306
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,990
agreement for many years that reform is needed.
We want to get this right, which is why we

307
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,879
are carefully considering the representations.

308
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:14,429
>> Alex Salmond (Gordon) (SNP):
After nine months of this Prime Minister’s

309
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:20,620
approach to Brexit, Northern Ireland is deadlocked,
the Welsh are alienated, Scotland is going

310
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,600
for a referendum, the English are split down
the middle, and Brexit MPs are walking out

311
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,760
of Commons Committees because they do not
like home truths. Has the Prime Minister considered,

312
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,230
in terms of invoking article 50, that “now
is not the time”?

313
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:52,010
>> The Prime Minister:
What the UK Government are doing in invoking

314
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:58,860
article 50 is putting into practice the democratic
vote of the British people on 23 June last

315
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,490
year in a referendum. There was a referendum
in 2014 in Scotland, when the Scottish people

316
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,460
voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.
I suggest the right hon. Gentleman and his

317
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,169
colleagues put that into practice.

318
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:18,840
>> Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness) (Con):
Three quarters of my constituents voted to

319
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:26,050
leave the European Union. Does the Prime Minister
agree that triggering article 50 marks a watershed

320
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:32,690
moment, not only in this country’s control
of immigration and our sovereignty, but in

321
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:40,539
listening to the views of people who were
forgotten for far too long?

322
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,500
>> The Prime Minister:
I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend; in

323
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,799
invoking article 50, we are not just putting
into practice the views of the British people

324
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,429
as set out in that referendum on 23 June last
year. Crucially, that was not just a vote

325
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:02,090
about leaving the EU; it was a vote about
changing this country for the future. This

326
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,200
Government have a clear plan for Britain that
will change this country, and that will see

327
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,390
us with a more global outlook, a stronger
economy, a fairer society and a more united

328
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,390
nation.

329
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,370
>> Marion Fellows (Motherwell and Wishaw)
(SNP):

330
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:22,870
The people expect the Prime Minister to follow
her party’s manifesto, and to abide by a

331
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:29,050
majority vote of this Parliament, so why does
she say that the First Minister of Scotland

332
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,260
should do the opposite?

333
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:43,320
>> The Prime Minister:
What I say is that as we face this historic

334
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,680
moment of invoking article 50 and setting
in process the negotiations for the future

335
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,600
of this country and its relationship with
the European Union, now is the time to pull

336
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,379
together and not try to hang apart.

337
00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:01,990
>> Derek Thomas (St Ives) (Con):
On Friday, thousands of people up and down

338
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,420
this country will be raising funds for and
awareness of brain tumour research. Many of

339
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,890
them will know someone, or have had a family
member, who has had a brain tumour or is suffering

340
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:18,870
from one, yet brain tumour research receives
only about 1% of all cancer research funding,

341
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:24,301
despite this being the biggest cancer killer
of children and adults under 40. Will the

342
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:28,179
Prime Minister join me in commending all these
people raising awareness and funds, and see

343
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,419
what more we can do to increase funding for
brain tumour research?

344
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:37,059
>> The Prime Minister:
This is a very important area, and the UK

345
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:44,150
has a good record of research on brain tumours.
My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the

346
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,280
people who are raising funds for this important
cause should be commended. As he said, many

347
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,920
of them will have had personal experience
of brain tumours, in one way or another. It

348
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,542
is important that we recognise that there
are many killers out there that often do not

349
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:05,560
receive the publicity and support that other
causes get. We should recognise their importance

350
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,170
and commend those who are raising funds.

351
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,760
>> Mr John Spellar (Warley) (Lab):
As we enter the world of article 50, will

352
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,990
the Prime Minister say what she is doing to
ensure that national and local government

353
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:24,540
prioritise the buying of British goods and
services? I have to say that her record on

354
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,419
police vehicles when she was Home Secretary
does not give us much cause for optimism.

355
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:35,110
>> The Prime Minister:
We have, as a Government, been encouraging

356
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,020
the procurement of British goods and services.
The right hon. Gentleman asks what we can

357
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,410
do for local authorities; if people around
the country want local authorities that take

358
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,629
their best interests to heart, they should
vote Conservative.

359
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:54,170
>> Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam) (Con):
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Prime

360
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:59,580
Minister on invoking article 50 today. Does
she agree that this needs to be the end of

361
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,720
the phoney war—the end of the posturing
we have heard from Members on the Opposition

362
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Benches—and that we must now focus on the
detail for every industry, sector and community,

363
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,360
so that we get a bespoke deal that we can
all get behind?

364
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,640
>> The Prime Minister:
I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. Now

365
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,370
is the time for us to come together, and to
be united across the House and across the

366
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,390
country to ensure that we work for the best
possible deal for the United Kingdom, and

367
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,220
the best possible future for us all.

368
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,580
>> Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP):
The Prime Minister has rightly emphasised

369
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,450
her determination to deliver for all the constituent
parts of the United Kingdom on this historic

370
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:42,580
day. While others are content to moan and
whine, we want to see that delivery, and we

371
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,440
are confident that she will make it happen.
In Northern Ireland, some have walked away

372
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,289
from their responsibilities with regard to
devolution, but we want to see devolution

373
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,610
up and running, and to have a functioning
Northern Ireland Government, and we have set

374
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,460
no preconditions in the way of that. If others
continue to stay away from devolution and

375
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,760
walk away, will the Prime Minister pledge
to work ever more closely with those of us

376
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,850
in this House to defend and protect the interests
of Northern Ireland?

377
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,950
>> The Prime Minister:
We all want to work together to ensure that

378
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:20,010
we protect the best interests of Northern
Ireland. As the right hon. Gentleman just

379
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,270
said, ensuring that we have strong devolved
government in Northern Ireland is important

380
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,241
for the future. It is important, so that we
can build on the significant progress that

381
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:34,250
has been made in recent years for the people
of Northern Ireland. I urge all parties to

382
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,429
come to the talks with a view to finding a
way through, so that Northern Ireland can

383
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,929
once again be restored to devolved government.

384
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:46,080
>> James Berry (Kingston and Surbiton) (Con):
Does the Prime Minister agree that social

385
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,950
media companies need to take action now to
remove extremist and hate materials from their

386
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,360
platforms proactively, and to foot the bill
for the police, who are currently doing those

387
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,610
companies’ dirty work at the taxpayer’s
expense?

388
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,780
>> The Prime Minister:
The whole question of working with the companies

389
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:09,130
to ensure that extremist material is removed
as quickly as possible is not new; that work

390
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,950
has been going on for a number of years. Through
the counter terrorism internet referral unit,

391
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,740
we have a process that enables the police
to take material down. Some 250,000 pieces

392
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,624
of material have been taken down from the
internet since February 2010, and there has

393
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:28,779
been a significant increase in that activity
in the past couple of years or so. My right

394
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,210
hon. Friend the Home Secretary will meet the
companies later this week to talk to them

395
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,500
about this important issue. We do not want
to see extremist material on the internet,

396
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:46,190
and we want to see companies taking action
to remove material that encourages hate and

397
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,190
division.

398
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,730
>> Alison McGovern (Wirral South) (Lab):
Late on Saturday night, a massive explosion

399
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,760
devastated New Ferry in my constituency. We
are thinking of all those who are hurt. It

400
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,929
is a miracle that more people were not injured.
The community now faces significant dereliction.

401
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:09,349
Will the Prime Minister join me in thanking
all those who looked after my community over

402
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:15,180
the weekend and in recent days? Will she arrange
for me a meeting with the Secretary of State

403
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,059
for Communities and Local Government, so that
we can discuss how the Government can help

404
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,590
us to rebuild New Ferry?

405
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,010
>> The Prime Minister:
I am very happy to do both of those things.

406
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:30,450
First, I commend and thank all those in the
emergency services and others who worked so

407
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:36,049
hard to support the hon. Lady’s local community
when the devastating explosion took place.

408
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,240
That work will continue; it did not happen
just over the weekend. Support will be given

409
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,418
to the community into the future. I am very
happy to ask the Secretary of State for Communities

410
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:52,388
and Local Government to meet her and discuss
how that community can be rebuilt and can

411
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,839
overcome the impact of this explosion.
