1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,240
>>Kelvin Hopkins (Luton North) (Lab): If she
will list her official engagements for Wednesday

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,240
18 January.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,230
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): This
morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,040
and others. In addition to my duties in this
House I will have further such meetings later

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,310
today.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,320
>>Kelvin Hopkins: Thousands of babies who
are born each year are damaged for life by

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,550
alcohol consumed in pregnancy. Patients affected
by alcohol put immense pressure on the national

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,570
health service, and alcohol is a primary factor
in domestic violence and attacks on women.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,870
Does the Prime Minister recognise the seriousness
of the country’s alcohol problems—the

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,260
damage to lives and the billions in costs
to the public purse—and will she instruct

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,270
her Government now to address these problems
effectively and as a matter of urgency?

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,330
>>The Prime Minister: I can certainly say
to the hon. Gentleman that I recognise the

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,290
problems that alcohol causes. He particularly
referenced not just problems for pregnant

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:03,730
women, but the part that alcohol often plays
in domestic violence and abuse. That was why,

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,299
when I was Home Secretary, we produced an
alcohol strategy and worked on the issue of

16
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,530
alcohol. The Government continue to recognise
the importance of this issue and to work on

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,530
it.

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,000
>>Mr Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury) (Con):
Will the Prime Minister join me in paying

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,640
tribute to the NHS staff who provide us with
such magnificent treatment day in, day out?

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,251
Does she agree that people who miss NHS appointments
without cancelling them cost the NHS a great

21
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:38,810
deal of money and also take up slots that
would otherwise be used by other patients?

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,360
Will she consider how she might let those
people know about the inconvenience that they

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,460
are causing to the NHS?

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,400
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend makes
two important points. First, I am very pleased

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,939
to join him in paying tribute to the dedication
and hard work of all those who work in our

26
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:01,120
national health service. Secondly, he is right
to point out that if somebody misses an appointment,

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,900
that is a cost to the NHS. There are a number
of ways in which this is being dealt with.

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,650
Some hospitals send out text messages that
not only remind people of their appointment,

29
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,860
but tell them how much it costs if they miss
it.

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:28,590
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): Yesterday
the Prime Minister snubbed Parliament and

31
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:36,640
snubbed the Brexit Committee’s recommendation
to bring forward a White Paper, while at the

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,190
same time describing the referendum as

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,480
“a vote to restore…our parliamentary democracy”.

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,480
This is about our jobs, living standards and
future prosperity; why will it not be scrutinised

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,790
by this House?

36
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:09,120
>>The Prime Minister: What I did yesterday
was to set out a plan for a global Britain.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:22,080
I set out a plan that will put the divisions
of last year behind us, and that shows a vision

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:30,959
for a stronger, fairer, more united, more
outward-looking, prosperous, tolerant, independent

39
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,360
and truly global Britain. It was a vision
that will shape a stronger future and build

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,800
a better Britain.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:54,959
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Restoring parliamentary democracy
while sidelining Parliament—it is not so

42
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:03,709
much the Iron Lady as the Irony Lady.

43
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:15,890
Yesterday the Prime Minister finally provided
some detail. May I urge her to stop her threats

44
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:24,069
of a bargain basement Brexit—a low-pay tax
haven on the shores of Europe? It would not

45
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:29,780
necessarily damage the EU, but it would certainly
damage this country, businesses, jobs and

46
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,949
public services. She demeans herself, her
office and our country’s standing by making

47
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,979
such threats.

48
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:44,029
>>The Prime Minister: What I set out yesterday
was a plan for a global Britain, bringing

49
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:52,089
prosperity to this country and jobs to people,
and spreading economic growth across the country.

50
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:56,869
Yesterday we learned a little more of the
right hon. Gentleman’s thinking on this

51
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:00,520
issue. He said:

52
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:09,620
“She has said, ‘leave the single market,’
but at the same time says she wants to have

53
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,279
access to the single market. I’m not quite
sure how that’s going to go down in Europe.

54
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:22,819
I think we have to have a deal that ensures
we have access to the market.”

55
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:37,259
I’ve got a plan; he doesn’t have a clue.

56
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:45,689
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Prime Minister was the
one who made the threat about slashing corporation

57
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:53,119
tax. If we reduce corporation tax to the lowest
common denominator, this country loses £120

58
00:05:53,119 --> 00:06:01,719
billion in revenue. How, then, do we fund
public services?

59
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:07,199
Last year the Prime Minister said that leaving
the single market could make trade deals “considerably

60
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,330
harder” and that

61
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,699
“while we could certainly negotiate our
own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee

62
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,159
that they would be on terms as good as those
we enjoy now”,

63
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:30,050
but yesterday she offered us only vague guarantees.
Does she now disagree with herself?

64
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:38,409
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
might also have noticed that when I spoke

65
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:43,300
in the remain campaign, I said that if we
voted to leave the European Union, the sky

66
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,959
would not fall in. Look at what has happened
to our economic situation since we voted to

67
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,479
leave the European Union.

68
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,770
The right hon. Gentleman talks about the future
of the economy. I want us to be an outward-looking

69
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,849
nation trading around the world, and bringing
prosperity and jobs into the United Kingdom.

70
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,439
The one thing that would be bad for the economy
is the answers that the right hon. Gentleman

71
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:13,009
has. He wants a cap on wages, no control on
immigration and to borrow an extra £500 billion.

72
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:21,879
That would not lead to prosperity; it would
lead to no jobs, no wages and no skills.

73
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:29,669
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Chancellor said after
the referendum that to lose single market

74
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,279
access would be “catastrophic”. A few
days later, the Health Secretary said:

75
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,639
“The first part of the plan must be clarity
that we will remain in the single market”.

76
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
The Prime Minister said something about “frictionless”
access to the single market and a bespoke

77
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,249
customs union deal. Could she give us a little
bit of certainty and clarity about this? Has

78
00:07:52,249 --> 00:08:00,249
she ruled out paying any kind of fee to achieve
access to what she describes as a “frictionless”

79
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,279
market?

80
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,479
>>The Prime Minister: Access to the single
market was exactly what I was talking about

81
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:14,819
yesterday in my speech. One of the key objectives
is that we negotiate a free trade agreement

82
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,659
with the European Union that gives us the
widest possible access for trading with, and

83
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,889
operating within, the European Union.

84
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,289
The right hon. Gentleman talks about frictionless
access. Actually, this was a separate point

85
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,839
about frictionless borders in relation to
the customs issue—a very important issue

86
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,219
for us regarding the relationship between
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

87
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:42,370
The Taoiseach and I, and all parties, are
absolutely on a single page about this. We

88
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,510
want to ensure that we have the best possible
arrangement that does not lead to the borders

89
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,690
of the past for Northern Ireland.

90
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,329
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The question was: will we
have to pay for access to the market or not?

91
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:59,459
The Prime Minister has not given an answer
to that.

92
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,000
Yesterday the Prime Minister set out a wish
list on immigration, referring to skills shortages

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,741
and high-skill migration. Does she now disagree
with the Secretary of State for Environment,

94
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:14,399
Food and Rural Affairs, who told an employers’
conference, “Don’t worry. You can still

95
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,560
have cheap EU labour after we leave the European
Union”?

96
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,569
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
talks about access. Yes, the whole point is

97
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:30,930
that we will negotiate a free trade agreement
with the European Union that is about the

98
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,690
best possible access for British business
to operate in European Union member states

99
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,690
and for European businesses to operate here
in the United Kingdom. It is about sitting

100
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,850
down and negotiating the best possible deal
for the United Kingdom. That is what I am

101
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,910
committed to, and it is what the Government
are going to deliver.

102
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,610
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was about how
much we are going to have to pay to have access

103
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,470
to the market—still no answer.

104
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,560
Yesterday the Prime Minister talked about
the pressure put on public services by migration.

105
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,290
May I just remind her—the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson) referred to this

106
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,670
earlier—that at the moment there are 55,000
EU citizens working in our national health

107
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:24,120
service, helping to treat all the people of
this country? There are 80,000 care workers

108
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,089
helping our—mainly elderly—people and
there are 5,000 teachers educating our children.

109
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:36,290
The real pressure on public services comes
from a Government who slashed billions from

110
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,939
the social care budget, who are cutting the
schools budget, and who are closing A&E departments,

111
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:49,160
walk-in centres and Sure Start centres. Instead
of threatening to turn Britain into an offshore

112
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,620
tax haven, let us welcome those who contribute
to our public services and fund those public

113
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:03,709
services properly so that we have the fully
functioning NHS that we all need and deserve.

114
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:09,710
>>The Prime Minister: I made it clear yesterday
that we value those who have come to the United

115
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,500
Kingdom and contribute to our economy and
society. There will still be people coming

116
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,279
to the United Kingdom from the European Union
when we leave the EU. The crucial issue is

117
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,860
that it is this Government who will be making
decisions about our immigration system for

118
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,100
people from the European Union. Yet again,
I say to the right hon. Gentleman that there

119
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,339
is indeed a difference between us—it is
very simple. When I look at the issue of Brexit—or,

120
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:45,110
indeed, at any other issue, such as the national
health service or social care—I consider

121
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:53,399
the issue, I set out my plan and I stick to
it. It is called leadership; he should try

122
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,300
it sometime.

123
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:04,529
>>Karl MᶜCartney (Lincoln) (Con): Yesterday
was a day for being bold and ambitious, and

124
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,139
I am sure that my right hon. Friend noted
during her busy day that Lincoln City football

125
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,920
club followed her lead last night, progressing
to the fourth round of the FA cup. While I

126
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,110
warmly welcome the PM’s speech yesterday,
I also note her recent comments about white

127
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,839
working-class boys and university. In the
past 10 years, half a million fewer males

128
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,730
than females have gone to university, males’
exam results have been lower at all levels,

129
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,610
and fewer males than females have started
apprenticeships. Despite my raising this issue

130
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,889
in a Westminster Hall debate with Education
Ministers four months ago, nothing has happened.

131
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:38,100
When can we expect to see practical action
on closing the gender education gap?

132
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,410
>>The Prime Minister: I join my hon. Friend
in congratulating Lincoln City on their victory

133
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:49,120
last night. I think it was a fitting tribute
to Graham Taylor that they won that match.

134
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,220
My hon. Friend raises an important point.
I have indeed highlighted the issue of particularly

135
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,589
white working-class boys, who are the group
in society least likely to go to university.

136
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,500
We are committed to making sure that every
child gets the opportunity to fulfil their

137
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,230
potential. That is about ensuring that apprenticeships
are accessible as possible. I am pleased to

138
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,149
tell my hon. Friend that the proportion of
apprenticeships started by males has increased

139
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:19,100
this year to almost 50%, and also that universities
expect to spend more than £800 million this

140
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,130
year on improving access and success for disadvantaged
students. We want everybody to achieve their

141
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,639
potential, whatever their background and whatever
their gender.

142
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,550
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): Shortly after
the Prime Minister confirmed that she wants

143
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:40,399
to take the UK out of the single European
market, the Scottish Parliament voted by a

144
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:48,360
large cross-party majority to remain in the
single European market, just as a large majority

145
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:57,439
of people in Scotland voted to remain in the
European Union. The Prime Minister said that

146
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:03,559
Scotland is an equal partner in the United
Kingdom. Does she still believe this is true

147
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,720
or is she just stringing the people of Scotland
along?

148
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,040
>>The Prime Minister: I refer the right hon.
Gentleman to my speech yesterday, in which

149
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,389
I reiterated my commitment to work with the
devolved Administrations to ensure their voice

150
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,000
is heard and their interests are taken into
account as we proceed along the path of negotiating

151
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,260
our exit from the European Union. I specifically
referenced the Scotland plan. I understand

152
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,209
that the Welsh Government will be producing
a plan for Wales for us to look at, too. The

153
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,829
Scotland plan will, I believe, be considered
tomorrow by the Joint Ministerial Committee

154
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:42,089
on European negotiations. We will be looking
at it seriously and working with the Scottish

155
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,110
Government on the proposals they bring forward.

156
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:52,470
>>Angus Robertson: Scotland’s leading economic
forecaster says that real wages will fall—[Interruption.]

157
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:00,620
We have Tories jeering and cheering when the
forecast for people’s income is that it

158
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:13,100
is likely to drop by £2,000 and that 80,000
people may lose their jobs in Scotland as

159
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:22,790
a result of the Prime Minister’s hard Tory
Brexit plan. Does the Prime Minister believe

160
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,579
that this is a price worth paying for her
“Little Britain” Brexit?

161
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,619
>>The Prime Minister: I repeat what I said
earlier: we will work to ensure we get the

162
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:38,509
best possible deal in terms of access to the
single market, and continue to co-operate

163
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:44,830
in partnership with the remaining 27 member
states of the European Union. The right hon.

164
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:52,139
Gentleman once again talks about the possibility
of a negative impact on Scotland if Scotland

165
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:58,279
were not part of the single market. His party
is dedicated to taking Scotland out of the

166
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,790
single market by taking it out of the United
Kingdom.

167
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,079
>>Richard Fuller (Bedford) (Con): This week,
directors of our larger companies have been

168
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:16,100
told by investors to rein in senior executive
pay, which is too often distorted by long-term

169
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,790
incentive plans that are too complex to manage
and too excessive in their rewards. Will my

170
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,570
right hon. Friend look at such schemes as
part of her corporate governance review?

171
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,779
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue. I am pleased to say that

172
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,189
the Government have already taken some action
on executive pay: giving shareholders the

173
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:41,149
power to veto pay policies, forcing companies
to disclose the pay of their board directors

174
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:46,220
and introducing tough transparency measures
for banks. I want to build on that, which

175
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,310
is why we published a Green Paper on how to
strengthen shareholders’ influence over

176
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,449
executive pay and introduced greater transparency.
I look forward to receiving representations

177
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,829
from my hon. Friend on this issue.

178
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,339
>>Kirsty Blackman (Aberdeen North) (SNP):
Will the Prime Minister provide a commitment

179
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:08,630
today that no part of the great repeal Bill
will be subject to English votes for English

180
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,250
laws?

181
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:22,030
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady might
recognise that the great repeal Bill will

182
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:32,440
deal with a number of complex issues. At its
heart will be the repeal of the European Communities

183
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:40,720
Act 1972. As we look at the Bill and at negotiating
our way out of the European Union, we will

184
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,799
need to look at the whole issue of reserved
matters and devolved matters, but there are

185
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,110
many aspects—[Interruption.]

186
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:53,822
>>Mr Speaker: Order. Members of the Scottish
National party, led by the right hon. Member

187
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,770
for Moray (Angus Robertson) on the Front Bench,
who is supposed to be a statesmanlike figure,

188
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:04,890
should demonstrate some calm and reserve while
they are being answered by the Prime Minister.

189
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:12,600
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady knows
full well that if any part of proposed legislation

190
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,730
brought before this House applies only to
England, it will be subject to English votes

191
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,590
for English laws.

192
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,809
>>Nadine Dorries (Mid Bedfordshire) (Con):
May I congratulate the Prime Minister on her

193
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,360
delivery yesterday of an historic, definitive,
pragmatic, outward-looking speech that saw

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:41,140
the pound rise to its highest level in two
years and the FTSE up today? Does she agree

195
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,441
that the strong and prosperous UK she has
planned would be a nightmare for the Leader

196
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:50,659
of the Opposition and the EU ruling class?

197
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:56,510
>>The Prime Minister: I agree with my hon.
Friend. A strong and prosperous Britain is

198
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,990
exactly what we want to build as we leave
the EU. It is only a pity that the Labour

199
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,600
party seems uninterested in doing that, but
wants to do the exact opposite and bring this

200
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,940
economy down.

201
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,830
>>Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab): If she will
visit the Rhondda.

202
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:18,330
>>The Prime Minister: I always enjoy my visits
to Wales, and I hope to visit Wales in the

203
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,330
future.

204
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,649
>>Chris Bryant: That is not quite an answer
to whether she will visit the Rhondda. I hope

205
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:30,919
she will; I am happy to accommodate her—I
can do bacon and eggs. More importantly, I

206
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,880
could take her to see the best brass band
in the world, the Cory band, or, for that

207
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:43,140
matter, I could take her to the local food
bank, based in the closed-down Conservative

208
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:54,200
club. Since 2010, the Government have closed
the local courts, tax office, Department for

209
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,130
Work and Pensions office and driving centre,
and now they intend to close all the tax offices

210
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,140
in Wales and centralise them in Cardiff. We
in the valleys feel ignored by the Government.

211
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:11,990
May I beg her to change direction and start
putting Government offices in the small towns,

212
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,149
villages and valleys of this country?

213
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:21,580
>>The Prime Minister: The last time I looked,
Cardiff was actually in Wales—the hon. Gentleman

214
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:29,810
says we are taking offices out of Wales and
putting them in Cardiff. The whole point of

215
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:36,049
what Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is
doing is to move from outdated offices to

216
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,169
large, modern regional centres, which will
make it possible to modernise its ways of

217
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,870
working, make tax collection more efficient
and actually improve its customer service.

218
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:51,730
>>Chris Green (Bolton West) (Con): I welcome
my right hon. Friend’s speech setting out

219
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,140
a plan for global Britain. It clearly shows
that those on the Government Benches are listening

220
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:04,080
to the British people. Will she commend this
approach to the council leaders now considering

221
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,539
the Greater Manchester spatial framework consultation
responses, as they need to listen to the people,

222
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,970
give us better infrastructure and protect
our green spaces?

223
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,919
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for his comments and for raising this issue.

224
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,269
I understand that the consultation on the
spatial framework closed earlier this week

225
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:31,980
and that there has been huge interest among
local people. I echo his comment that it is

226
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,169
absolutely right that local leaders should
take into account all the representations

227
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,169
made.

228
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:44,240
>>Ian Blackford (Ross, Skye and Lochaber)
(SNP): In the UK, we have 14 regional markets

229
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,270
for electricity distribution, and highlanders
and islanders are facing higher prices because

230
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,929
of where we live. Electricity distribution
charges for the north of Scotland are an eye-watering

231
00:21:54,929 --> 00:22:02,000
84% higher than those for London. The Prime
Minister talks about fairness. Will she introduce

232
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,789
a universal market for electricity pricing
and stop penalising highlanders and islanders?

233
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:12,870
Those of us who live in the coldest, windiest
places are discriminated against by her Government,

234
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,340
and it must end.

235
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,220
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman draws
attention to the fact that geography of course

236
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,539
has an impact on these matters. He talks about
living in the coldest and windiest places,

237
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:37,361
and obviously one interesting issue in Scotland
is the opportunity for renewables there. I

238
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:50,880
can tell him, however, that we are looking
at making sure that energy markets in the

239
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,779
UK are indeed working properly.

240
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,700
>>Andrew Selous (South West Bedfordshire)
(Con): I am pleased that the Prime Minister

241
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,399
has said that she will take the necessary
action on air quality to deal with the 40,000

242
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:09,100
premature deaths it causes across our country
every year. I know she believes in her Government

243
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,799
leading by example, so will she make sure
that all diesel cars are removed from the

244
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,679
Government Car Service as soon as possible?

245
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,460
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right that improving air quality is a priority

246
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,159
for the Government. We are determined to cut
harmful emissions and have committed money

247
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,470
since 2011 to supporting the take-up of low-emission
vehicles. The Government Car Service is working

248
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,950
to remove diesel vehicles from its fleet.
It has so far replaced a quarter of its vehicles

249
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,230
with petrol hybrid cars, and of course its
work continues to remove those diesel vehicles.

250
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,670
>>Mr Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):
Is the Prime Minister aware that I totally

251
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:58,860
agree with what she said yesterday—[Interruption.]
Wait for it. I agree that we in this House

252
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,730
have a real responsibility to ensure that
our children and grandchildren have a bright

253
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,350
future, but is she aware that dark clouds
are looming on the horizon—intolerance,

254
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,559
racism across Europe and the foundering and
flux of many of our great institutions that

255
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:22,140
have kept peace and prosperity since the last
world war? I speak here of the United Nations,

256
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,760
NATO and, indeed, the European Union. Are
we fit for purpose in keeping this country

257
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,460
safe and secure in that world?

258
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:38,220
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely recognise
the important issue that the hon. Gentleman

259
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,389
has raised. It is precisely as we move out
of the European Union that the United Kingdom

260
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:47,549
will be more outward looking. We will look
globally. We want to ensure that we continue

261
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:53,130
to play our part in the United Nations and
that the UN is able to do the job that everybody

262
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:59,480
wants it to do. NATO has obviously been the
most important bulwark when it comes to maintaining

263
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,549
safety and security across the European continent.
That is why we are continuing to support NATO.

264
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:11,409
British troops are in Estonia, and British
forces are in Poland and Romania, which shows

265
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,500
our continuing commitment to NATO. The thrust
of my speech yesterday was that we want a

266
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,429
strong strategic partnership with the European
Union. We want access to the single market

267
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,830
through a free trade agreement, but we also
want to continue to work with the EU on justice

268
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,059
and security matters. Now is not a time to
co-operate less; it is a time to co-operate

269
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,059
more.

270
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:38,580
>>Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam) (Con): I
am delighted at the third-round FA cup replay,

271
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,649
in which Sutton United won 3-1 against Wimbledon.
However, the pressing issue—what would make

272
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:47,789
us really happy—is being able to get to
work on a day-to-day basis. Does the Prime

273
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,789
Minister share my cautious optimism that a
return to talks by ASLEF and Southern can

274
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,809
provide a long-lasting solution for hard-pressed
commuters?

275
00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:01,010
>>The Prime Minister: As a former Wimbledon
councillor, I am not sure that I quite share

276
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:07,530
the enthusiasm of my hon. Friend for the defeat
of AFC Wimbledon. On the point about the train

277
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,380
strikes, yes, I do; and I hope that those
sitting around the table are going to ensure

278
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,250
that an agreement will be reached to enable
passengers to be able to get on with their

279
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,580
lives and their jobs, and not suffer the misery
that was brought about by the strike in the

280
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
first place.

281
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,909
>>Siobhain McDonagh (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab):
I agree with the Prime Minister and disagree

282
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,659
with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam
(Paul Scully) about last night’s AFC Wimbledon

283
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:36,690
result. If the Prime Minister really believes
that GP surgeries should be open seven days

284
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,771
a week, 12 hours a day, will she be my guest
at a residents’ meeting against a Department

285
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:49,900
of Health diktat that will close the 6,000-strong
Mitcham Wilson surgery? Even better, will

286
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,380
she just tell her Government to stop cuts
to GP services, which force thousands to attend

287
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,549
hard-pressed A&amp;Es such as those at St
George’s and St Helier, or is she just happy

288
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,470
to oversee the possible collapse of the NHS
on her watch?

289
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:11,590
>>The Prime Minister: I might remind the hon.
Lady that she and I sat on a council together

290
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,070
where we tried to keep Wimbledon actually
playing in Wimbledon, or at least in the borough

291
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,200
of Merton rather than moving elsewhere.

292
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,350
On the point about GP services, GPs are part
of the solution for the NHS in the future.

293
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:33,470
That is why we have seen more GPs coming into
the NHS and 5,000 more are being trained and

294
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:40,220
will be in place by 2020. We want to ensure
that GPs are open and providing services at

295
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,590
times when the patients want to access them.

296
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,620
>>Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) (Con): It was quite
clear from the Prime Minister’s speech yesterday

297
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:54,210
that she seeks to build a Brexit consensus
and to bring our country back together. I

298
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:00,830
thank her for that. To that end, and indeed
to strengthen the Prime Minister’s negotiating

299
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:07,080
hand, before article 50 is triggered, will
she please at least consider publishing all

300
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,769
those 12 objectives in a White Paper so that
we can debate them here in this place on behalf

301
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:17,080
of all our constituents?

302
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:24,620
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely understand
my right hon. Friend’s point about Parliament’s

303
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,160
desire to be able to debate the objectives
that I set out very clearly in my plan yesterday.

304
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,000
One of the objectives and principles I set
was about certainty and clarity. It continues

305
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,720
to be the Government’s intention that we
will provide clarity whenever it is possible,

306
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,740
and we will ensure that, at appropriate times,
both the public and Parliament are kept informed

307
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,139
and are able properly to consider and scrutinise
these issues.

308
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:57,559
>>Mrs Louise Ellman (Liverpool, Riverside)
(Lab/Co-op): While dedicated and talented

309
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,789
staff at Royal Liverpool University hospital’s
accident and emergency department struggle

310
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:12,340
to find beds for sick people, about 135 patients
cannot be discharged solely because of Government

311
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,820
cuts in social care budgets. When will the
Government recognise their responsibilities,

312
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:24,220
and not try to blame GPs for a problem of
their Government’s own making?

313
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:30,720
>>The Prime Minister: There is pressure on
social care. I have accepted and recognised

314
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
that in the House. The Government have recognised
it, and have provided additional funding through

315
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,759
the Better Care Fund and the social care precept.
This year Liverpool raised £2.8 million from

316
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,840
the precept, and it will receive more than
£48 million on top of that from the improved

317
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,519
Better Care Fund by 2019-20. However, this
is not just a question of money; it is a question

318
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,779
of ensuring that we have a sustainable social
care system for the future, and that is what

319
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,179
the Government are working on.

320
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,850
>>Alistair Burt (North East Bedfordshire)
(Con): May I commend my right hon. Friend

321
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,630
for what she said yesterday, and not least
for her constructive tone and constructive

322
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,519
approach to the European Union and its future?
That was in marked contrast to what we have

323
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,340
heard from others over the years, from many
different quarters in the United Kingdom.

324
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,649
Will my right hon. Friend confirm that that
constructive tone will remain, as the best

325
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,289
base for securing an agreement between us
and the EU that is in our mutual interest?

326
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,600
Will she also confirm that the default position
of “no deal” will remain a default position,

327
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,630
and that the Government will not be persuaded
to make it their preferred option?

328
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,649
>>The Prime Minister: Absolutely. We want
to get that good deal and we expect to be

329
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:38,950
able to get that good deal, and, as my right
hon. Friend says, it is through good will

330
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,960
and a positive approach on both sides of the
negotiations that we will achieve it.

331
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,130
I am very clear about the fact that the United
Kingdom wants to see a continuing, strong

332
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,909
European Union of 27 member states. We want
a strong strategic partnership with that European

333
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:57,399
Union, and, of course, we want to continue
to work bilaterally with individual member

334
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:02,190
states. I made that point to a number of European
leaders yesterday when I spoke to them after

335
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:08,019
my speech. I said that we wanted to approach
this in a positive and optimistic fashion,

336
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:11,630
because I believe that a deal that is good
for the UK will be a deal that is good for

337
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,630
the European Union.

338
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:18,090
>>Louise Haigh (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab):
This week the national auditor revealed the

339
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:23,690
abject failures in the Concentrix fiasco which
had resulted in thousands of people being

340
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:30,970
wrongly denied their tax credit. That was
not one rogue contractor, but a system designed

341
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,149
by the Government to pursue and chase down
claimants for profit. Does the Prime Minister

342
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:43,840
agree with the chief executive of HMRC that
payment by results has no place in our welfare

343
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,789
system? Will she review this model, or will
she wait for the next scandal to hit vulnerable

344
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:50,789
people?

345
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:55,789
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise that many
people received a poor service from Concentrix.

346
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,899
This is not the first time that that has been
highlighted in the Chamber. It was not acceptable,

347
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:04,429
and I apologise for the worry and distress
that was caused to people. We have been very

348
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,799
clear about the service operated by Concentrix.
HMRC will learn the lessons from that contract,

349
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:15,639
and it remains committed to providing a high-quality
service. It will not use a private sector

350
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,970
supplier to undertake tax credit error and
fraud checks again.

351
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:27,530
>>Mr Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con): My
right hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe

352
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,120
(Anna Soubry) mentioned the speech that the
Prime Minister made yesterday. In that speech,

353
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,350
she confirmed her commitment to parliamentary
democracy, and I assume that she therefore

354
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,399
accepts the long-standing convention that
the Executive—the Government—are continuously

355
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:49,809
accountable to the House for the policies
that they are pursuing. Will she clarify whether

356
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:55,360
she intends to make any further statements
of policy intentions to the House, and whether

357
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,230
she expects the House to have an opportunity
to vote its approval for those policies earlier

358
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,850
than two years from now, when the whole negotiation
has been completed?

359
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:12,360
>>The Prime Minister: My right hon. and learned
Friend has raised a matter that has also been

360
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,840
raised not only by our right hon. Friend the
Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), but by

361
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,169
others as well. Yesterday my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Exiting the European

362
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:30,090
Union spent two hours answering questions
in the House, and there will be a further

363
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:36,580
debate on matters relating to exiting the
European Union later today. There have been

364
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:42,240
a number of such debates already, dealing
with issues that are part of the objectives

365
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,970
that we have set.

366
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,470
We shall have to consider the result of the
decision of the Supreme Court, which may,

367
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,790
if it goes against the Government, require
legislation. There will be an opportunity

368
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,030
in the great repeal Bill to consider a number
of issues relating to exiting the EU, but

369
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,200
as for voting on the actual deal that we have,
we cannot do so until we know what it is.

370
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,390
That is why I said yesterday that Parliament
would have a vote when we knew what the deal

371
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,390
was.

372
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,309
>>Dr Eilidh Whiteford (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):
The Prime Minister’s passing reference to

373
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,180
the interests of Spanish fishermen in her
speech yesterday rather let the cat out of

374
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,589
the bag that our fishing opportunities are
already on the table as a bargaining chip

375
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,800
before the Brexit negotiations have even started,
so what exactly does the Prime Minister want

376
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,540
to offer the Spanish fishermen?

377
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,430
>>The Prime Minister: I made the very simple
point yesterday that this negotiation is not

378
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,819
just about the United Kingdom; there will
be others in the European Union who will be

379
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,920
looking to ensure that the deal we get is
good for the UK and good for the EU. But I

380
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,010
have to say to the hon. Lady that if she in
any sense thinks that continued membership

381
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,840
of the common fisheries policy is what we
should be looking for, that is certainly not

382
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,710
the case, and it is certainly one of the things
people voted against.

383
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,320
>>Jeremy Lefroy (Stafford) (Con): The people
of Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent are again

384
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,770
being confronted with the possible loss of
emergency services in Stafford or Burton,

385
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,220
when our acute hospitals are constantly under
intense pressure. Does the Prime Minister

386
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,310
agree with me, our hon. Friend the Member
for Burton (Andrew Griffiths) and other local

387
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:23,430
MPs that closing A&Es is no way to deal with
increased real—not imagined—need?

388
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:29,710
>>The Prime Minister: The important issue
is the level of service that is available

389
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,410
to people in any particular local area. That
is why the sustainability and transformation

390
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,580
plans that are being considered and have been
published are being taken into account and

391
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,530
being considered at a local level, so that
local clinicians and local people will be

392
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,920
able to agree what is best in their particular
area.

393
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,970
>>Gordon Marsden (Blackpool South) (Lab):
Last Friday I went to Blackpool Victoria hospital

394
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,300
where the number of people waiting 12 hours
or more in A&amp;E doubled last year, with

395
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,080
100 of them aged 90 or over. Trust managers
told me that the biggest factor in delays

396
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,370
is discharging patients who cannot get community
care, and my local paper said that Government

397
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:12,220
cuts have eroded support for them. Will the
Prime Minister stop waffling about her shared

398
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,600
society, listen to her own budget watchdog
saying that we will need £30 billion for

399
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,370
older people in the next 10 years, and put
that money not into corporation tax cuts but

400
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,240
into local adult care and the NHS?

401
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,570
>>The Prime Minister: Just looking at the
figures on what has happened in health in

402
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,490
the hon. Gentleman’s area, I see that there
are more doctors in his NHS foundation trust

403
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:43,460
and significantly more nurses, but the—[Interruption.]
I know what the hon. Gentleman is talking

404
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:50,800
about and I am about to comment on it, but
the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela

405
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,110
Rayner), who is shouting from a sedentary
position, might have recognised that he started

406
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,260
off talking about the NHS, which is what I
am also commenting on. [Interruption.]

407
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,430
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I am not going to allow
an exchange across the Dispatch Box or across

408
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,550
the House at this point. The Prime Minister
was asked a question [Interruption.] Order.

409
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,820
I require no help from the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr Mahmood), which

410
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:21,640
is of zilch value. The Prime Minister will
answer, and she will be heard with courtesy,

411
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,700
including by the hon. Gentleman.

412
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,431
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Member for
Blackpool South (Gordon Marsden) asked me

413
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:31,840
about pressures on the national health service.
We are seeing more doctors and nurses in his

414
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,450
Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust, and health funding in the hon. Gentleman’s

415
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:45,750
area will be £3 billion this year, and that
will be rising with a further £450 million

416
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,290
by 2020-21.

417
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,329
As I have said in this House before, we are
putting extra money into social care. We are

418
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:57,090
giving local authorities the opportunity to
raise more money and spend it on social care.

419
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,060
But this is not just about more money; it
is about ensuring best practice is spread

420
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,660
throughout the country and it is about a long-term
solution to sustainable social care for the

421
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,930
future, an issue that has been ducked by Governments,
including a Labour Government for 13 years.

422
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:17,400
>>Matt Warman (Boston and Skegness) (Con):
On Friday the east coast of England faced

423
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,250
the threat of a tidal surge that endangered
tens of thousands of homes and thousands of

424
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:28,000
lives. A simple change in the weather meant
that flooding was averted, but will the Prime

425
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Minister join me in praising the response
of the emergency services in planning ahead,

426
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,210
involving the Army, the Coastguard, the fire
and ambulance services and the police, to

427
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,770
make sure that the best possible plans were
made? Will she further join me in making sure

428
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:50,100
that the public know that in future these
warnings should always be taken seriously?

429
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,500
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important point, and I am happy to join

430
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,430
him in commending the action of all those
in the emergency services, in our armed forces

431
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:05,530
and in local authorities who worked so hard
to ensure that this problem was dealt with.

432
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:11,320
As he said, a change in the weather took place,
but it is crucial that when these warnings

433
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,271
are given, people recognise that they are
given for the very good reason that there

434
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:21,780
is concern about the danger that could take
place. The efforts that were put in protected

435
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,681
tens of thousands of properties, and I am
pleased to see that we have learned from the

436
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:32,110
work done on previous flooding incidents.
The work between the emergency services, local

437
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:37,200
services and the armed forces was much better
co-ordinated than has perhaps been the case

438
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,030
in the past, so we have been able to learn
from the flooding in the past.

439
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,600
>>Meg Hillier (Hackney South and Shoreditch)
(Lab/Co-op): In response to the right hon.

440
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,980
Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), the Prime
Minister talked about her desire to give clarity

441
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,050
around our exit from the EU. Many of my constituents
are European citizens who are paying tax and

442
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,590
bringing up their families here. What assurance
can she give them about their future, particularly

443
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,840
if they change employer or are freelancers?

444
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,300
>>The Prime Minister: One of the objectives
I set out in my speech yesterday was something

445
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,240
I have said before about the guaranteeing
of rights for EU citizens living here in the

446
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,000
UK, but I also want to see the rights of UK
citizens living in the 27 member states being

447
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,040
guaranteed. I remain open, and I encourage
others across Europe to agree with me that

448
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,690
this is an issue we should look at as early
as possible in order to give people the confidence

449
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,580
and reassurance that the hon. Lady is looking
for .

450
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,670
>>Simon Hoare (North Dorset) (Con): In supporting
my right hon. Friend’s endeavours in facing

451
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,940
the difficult challenges in social care and
the national health service, may I invite

452
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,470
her to endorse the concept and continuance
of community hospitals in our market towns

453
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,450
across the country? Those hospitals, including
the Westminster Memorial hospital in Shaftesbury

454
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:57,430
in my constituency, provide a vital piece
of the jigsaw in our national health service.

455
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:07,690
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure that the Westminster
Memorial hospital in Shaftesbury is providing

456
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,510
good services for local people. The structure
of local services is of course a matter for

457
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,700
discussion at local level, and it is crucial
that local clinicians and others agree that

458
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,390
we have a safe and secure service for people
and that they are provided with the NHS services

459
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,890
that they need at the most appropriate level.
I fully accept my hon. Friend’s point that

460
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,140
we often think only about the major district
general hospitals and acute hospitals when

461
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,430
actually the NHS is made up of many different
parts. We need to ensure that patients are

462
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,670
being treated at the most appropriate level
for their needs.

463
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:50,630
>>Hywel Williams (Arfon) (PC): How can abandoning
membership of a customs union that takes 68%

464
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:56,750
of Wales’s exports—including, crucially,
90% of our food and drink exports—and that

465
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,550
supports 200,000 jobs cause anything other
than “calamitous…self-harm”?

466
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:07,630
>>The Prime Minister: What we will be doing
is negotiating a free trade agreement with

467
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,230
the European Union to get the best possible
access for trade with the EU, but we also

468
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,330
want to be able to negotiate trade agreements
with other countries around the world. A number

469
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,320
of countries have already expressed interest
in doing that with us. We want to do that

470
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,830
to open up new export markets being delivered
for businesses here in the United Kingdom,

471
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:31,550
including the sort of trade in Wales that
the hon. Gentleman is talking about. On the

472
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,490
question of customs with the European Union,
we want an arrangement that will involve the

473
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,290
most frictionless borders possible.
