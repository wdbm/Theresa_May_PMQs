1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,520
>>Mrs Sheryll Murray (South East Cornwall)
(Con): If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,520
for Wednesday 8 March.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,520
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that Members across the House will

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,440
wish to join me in marking International Women’s
Day, as we celebrate the social, economic,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,619
cultural and political achievements of women
both here and around the world. We are also

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,029
redoubling our efforts to tackle the problems
that women all too often still face.

7
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:29,939
This morning, I had meetings with Ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,899
in this House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:40,500
>>Mrs Murray: I join the Prime Minister in
celebrating International Women’s Day. Since

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,280
2010, Conservatives in government have a proud
record of protecting and supporting both the

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,950
victims and those at risk of domestic violence
and abuse. I saw that myself when I visited

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,149
my local police, and I thank them for the
difficult job that they do. The evil is that

13
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,930
far too many women are still at risk and are
still suffering. What more can the Prime Minister

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,689
do to tackle this abhorrent crime?

15
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,360
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a serious issue. It is one in which I have

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,371
taken a particular personal interest, and
I attach great importance to the issue. Tackling

17
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:23,030
domestic violence and abuse is a key priority
for the Government. What we have already done

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,520
in government has the potential to transform
the way in which we think about and tackle

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,240
these terrible crimes when they take place.
We have already committed to bringing forward

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,670
new legislation, and I have confirmed today
an additional £20 million to support organisations

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,430
working to tackle domestic violence and abuse.
This means that the total funding available

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,439
for our strategy to end violence against women
and girls will be over £100 million in this

23
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,710
Parliament.

24
00:01:51,710 --> 00:02:02,250
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): May
I start by wishing all women a very happy

25
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,000
International Women’s Day today? I am proud
that the Labour party has more women MPs than

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,940
all other parties in this House combined and
a shadow Cabinet of which half the members

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,180
are women.

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:30,290
A month ago, I raised the question of the
leaked texts between the leader of Surrey

29
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,200
County Council and Government officials about
social care. The Prime Minister’s response

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,880
was to accuse me of peddling “alternative
facts”. Will she explain the difference

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,910
between a sweetheart deal and a gentleman’s
agreement?

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,280
>>The Prime Minister: First, the right hon.
Gentleman references women in this House,

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,090
and I point out to him that, actually, the
Conservative party has recently taken a further

34
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,370
measure in relation to women in this House
by replacing a Labour male MP with a female

35
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:20,140
Conservative.

36
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,481
The right hon. Gentleman asks about the issue
in relation to Surrey County Council. The

37
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:30,590
substance of what he asks is whether there
has been a particular deal with Surrey County

38
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:42,330
Council that is not available to other councils,
and the answer is no. As I have said before,

39
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,640
the ability to raise a social care precept
of 3% is available to every council. The ability

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:57,440
to retain 100% of business rates will be available
to a number of councils in April. Let us look

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,120
at them: Liverpool, Manchester and London.
What do we know about those councils? They

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,860
are all under Labour control. So what he is
actually asking me is why a Conservative council

43
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,590
should have access to an arrangement that
is predominantly currently available to Labour

44
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,590
councils.

45
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:26,800
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was about the
arrangement between the Government and Surrey

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:38,110
County Council. A recording has now emerged
showing that the leader of Surrey County Council,

47
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,690
David Hodge, said that there was a “gentleman’s
agreement” between him and the Government

48
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,680
that meant that the council would not have
to go ahead with a referendum. My question

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,990
is: what deal was done with Surrey County
Council? There is an acute social care crisis

50
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,271
affecting every council, with £4.6 billion
of cuts made to social care since 2010. Can

51
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:09,349
the Prime Minister tell every other council
in England what gentleman’s agreement is

52
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,460
available for them?

53
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,099
>>The Prime Minister: On today of all days,
if the right hon. Gentleman could just be

54
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:23,719
a little patient and wait half an hour for
the Budget, he will find out what social care

55
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:31,400
funding is available to all councils. If he
is asking me whether there was a special deal

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:39,069
for Surrey that was not available to other
councils, the answer is no. If he is looking

57
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:46,219
to uncover a conspiracy, I suggest he looks
behind him.

58
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:56,949
>>Jeremy Corbyn: If all the arrangements are
so clear and above board, will the Prime Minister

59
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:04,581
place in the Library of the House a record
of all one-to-one meetings between the Secretary

60
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,289
of State for Communities and Local Government
and the Chancellor and any council leader

61
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:16,080
or chair of social services anywhere in England?
If there is no special deal, can she explain

62
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,279
why Surrey is the only county council to be
allowed into the business rates retention

63
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,490
pilot when it has been denied to others?

64
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:37,460
>>The Prime Minister: The business rates retention
pilot will come into force for a number of

65
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:46,639
councils this April, and that includes, as
I have already said, Liverpool, Greater Manchester,

66
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,689
Greater London and others. In 2019-20, it
will be available to 100% of councils. Councils

67
00:06:53,689 --> 00:07:01,300
will be able to apply to be part of a further
pilot in 2018-19, and that goes for all councils

68
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,479
across the country.

69
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,280
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The text said that there
was a memorandum of understanding, and the

70
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,180
Prime Minister said that there was no deal.
She is now unclear about that. Did she actually

71
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,409
know what arrangement was made with Surrey
County Council? She is not keen to answer

72
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,759
questions about that.

73
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:34,289
There is another area of deep concern across
the whole country. Can the Prime Minister

74
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:40,000
tell us how many new school places will be
needed by 2020?

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,139
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
really should listen to the answers I give

76
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,720
before he asks the next question. He said
I did not answer the question about a special

77
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,949
deal for Surrey; I think that I have now answered
it three times, but I shall do it a fourth

78
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,499
time: there was no special deal for Surrey
that was not available to other councils.

79
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:12,479
>>Jeremy Corbyn The Prime Minister was also
asked just a moment ago about the number of

80
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,839
new school places needed by 2020. Perhaps
she could explain why we have a crisis in

81
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,270
school places and class sizes are soaring,
thanks to her Government. What is the answer

82
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,319
on the number of new school places needed,
Prime Minister?

83
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,020
>>The Prime Minister: This Government have
a policy that is about not only increasing

84
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,680
the number of school places but doing more
than that. I want to increase the number of

85
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,830
good school places, so that every child has
an opportunity to go to a good school. That

86
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,750
is what the money we are putting into education
is about. It includes money for new free schools,

87
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:02,250
which will be faith schools, university schools,
comprehensives, grammar schools and maths

88
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,520
schools. There will be a diversity, because
what I want is a good school place for every

89
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,930
child and for parents to have a choice. What
the right hon. Gentleman wants is for parents

90
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,180
to take what they are given, good or bad.

91
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,820
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The National Audit Office
tells us that a very large number of new school

92
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,940
places are needed—420,000. Nothing the Prime
Minister has said gets anywhere near to that.

93
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,750
Instead, she proposes a flagship scheme to
build the wrong schools in the wrong places,

94
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,570
spending millions on vanity projects such
as grammar schools and free schools, while

95
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:48,600
at the same time per-pupil funding is falling
in real terms. Is it not time that this colossal

96
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,240
waste of money was addressed? It is doing
nothing to help the vast majority of children

97
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,750
and nothing to solve the crisis of school
places and soaring class sizes. That is what

98
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,160
every parent wants, not vanity projects from
her Government.

99
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:13,180
>>The Prime Minister: It is no vanity project
to want every child to have a good school

100
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:19,600
place. The majority of free schools that have
been opened have been in areas where there

101
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,670
is a need for school places, and the majority
have been opened in areas of disadvantage,

102
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,780
where they are helping the very children we
want to see have the opportunity to get on

103
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,180
in life. I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman
that this is about a fairer society. On this

104
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,100
Budget day, we see that we are securing the
economy; Labour want to weaken it. We are

105
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:50,470
working for a fairer society; Labour oppose
every single reform. We are fighting for the

106
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:57,000
best deal for Britain; Labour are fighting
among themselves. That is Labour: weak, divided

107
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,180
and unfit to govern this great country.

108
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:10,340
>>Maggie Throup (Erewash) (Con): This week
in Erewash, it is likely that, sadly, four

109
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,560
people will suffer a stroke. With that in
mind and given that the current highly successful

110
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,060
stroke strategy expires later this year, will
my right hon. Friend commit her Government

111
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,930
to publish an updated strategy that includes
advances in stroke treatments, such as mechanical

112
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,630
thrombectomy, which dramatically improves
outcomes for one in 10 patients?

113
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,420
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend has raised
an important issue. I assure her that the

114
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:44,120
NHS wants to continue to build on the successes
of the current stroke strategy. We all recognise

115
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,400
that there have been huge improvements in
stroke care over the past decade, and we want

116
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,770
to deliver our ambition for truly world-leading
care. On the particular treatment to which

117
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,340
she refers, I understand that the NHS has
already approved the use of mechanical clot

118
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,260
retrieval in specific cases. The NHS rigorously
audits the quality of stroke care throughout

119
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,340
the country, so that we can ensure we are
delivering on our commitments. We have some

120
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,130
of the fastest improvements in hospital recovery
rate for strokes and heart attacks in Europe.

121
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,830
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): On International
Women’s Day, we wish all campaigners for

122
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:25,980
equality well, including those from the Women
Against State Pension Inequality Campaign.

123
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,530
The cross-party Brexit Committee has recommended
that the UK must guarantee the status of EU

124
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:39,630
nationals living in the UK and act unilaterally,
if necessary. The Committee went on to say:

125
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,320
“The current process for consideration of
permanent residency applications is not fit

126
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,030
for purpose and, in the absence of any concrete
resolution to relieve the anxiety felt by

127
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:57,840
the estimated three million EU citizens resident
in the UK, it is untenable to continue with

128
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,800
the system as it stands.”

129
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,881
Given the massive positive contribution that
European nationals make to this country, what

130
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:08,300
concrete plans does the Prime Minister have
to deal with this matter?

131
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,750
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, we want to have an early agreement

132
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,110
that will enable us to guarantee the status
of EU citizens living in the UK, but also

133
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,830
we need to guarantee the status of UK citizens
living in the European Union. On the process

134
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:33,080
of application, the Home Office is looking
at that and at how it can improve the systems

135
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,040
and simplify them, which is something that
it regularly does.

136
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,790
>>Angus Robertson: Since 2010, the Home Office
has seen its full-time equivalent staff cut

137
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,310
by 10%, so, at current rates of processing
applications for permanent residency, it would

138
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:56,800
take the Home Office more than 50 years to
deal with 3.2 million European nationals living

139
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,030
in the UK. That is clearly totally and utterly
unacceptable. Will the Prime Minister tell

140
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:09,570
us how quickly she hopes to be able to guarantee
all European nationals permanent residency?

141
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,500
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
cannot just stand up and say that because

142
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,460
the Home Office is getting more efficient,
it will take longer for answers to be given.

143
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,740
Yes, the Home Office is getting more efficient
at dealing with these things. I do not know

144
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,350
whether he has ever heard about technology,
but these days people apply online and they

145
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,750
are dealt with online.

146
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:41,240
>>Chris Green (Bolton West) (Con): Following
the recent findings of a study of terror convictions

147
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,230
in Britain, it is clear that there are serious
problems with how communities integrate into

148
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,800
society and a danger that that lack of integration
leads to acts of terror. Will the Prime Minister

149
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,860
update the House on the Government’s counter-extremism
strategy and response to these findings?

150
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,490
>>The Prime Minister: Again, this is a very
serious issue that my hon. Friend has raised.

151
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,060
The Government are taking a comprehensive
approach to tackling terrorism and violent

152
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,230
extremism at source, but also, through our
counter-extremism strategy, we are looking

153
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,780
at extremism more widely. We want to defeat
not just terrorism and violent extremism but

154
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,940
extremism wherever it occurs. We will shortly
be publishing a new counter-terrorism strategy.

155
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,440
In the coming months, we will be responding
to Dame Louise Casey’s report on integration.

156
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,120
That is backed up by additional investment
in our security and intelligence agencies—£2.5

157
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,590
billion over five years—and I am clear that
the Government are doing everything they can

158
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,670
to tackle issues around integration, extremism
and terrorism.

159
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,100
>>Tracy Brabin (Batley and Spen) (Lab): I
come from a Westminster Hall debate on behalf

160
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,480
of my young constituent Sam, who is 11 years
old. He developed narcolepsy as a result of

161
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,010
receiving the Pandemrix vaccine to protect
him from the swine flu. Sam’s mum, Di, is

162
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,750
in the Public Gallery today. In these rare
and devastating cases, the link between Pandemrix

163
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,790
and narcolepsy is proven, yet families like
Di’s face long legal battles with the Government.

164
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,300
Will the Prime Minister today promise that
no more of these disabled children will be

165
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:24,850
hounded through the courts, apologise to the
families concerned and oversee payments to

166
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,050
support the children’s long-term care needs?

167
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,440
>>The Prime Minister: May I first congratulate
the hon. Lady on securing a Westminster Hall

168
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,180
debate on this important topic? At the end
of her question, she refers to the issue of

169
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,860
payments. I am sure she realises that the
vaccine damage payment scheme is not a compensation

170
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,880
scheme, but a one-off tax-free lump sum that
is paid to help to ease the burden of those

171
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,190
who are disabled as a result of vaccination,
and it is part of a range of support that

172
00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,590
is provided. She has raised a very specific
case. Obviously she has had that Westminster

173
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,160
Hall debate, but we want to ensure that the
process is open and fair at every stage. The

174
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,889
Department for Work and Pensions does look
at every claim based on its own facts. If

175
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:12,349
she wants to write with the details, I am
sure that my hon. Friend the Minister for

176
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,458
Disabled People, Health and Work will look
into the specific case that she has raised.

177
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,770
>>Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con): What
recent assessment she has made of the (a)

178
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,380
performance of the economy and (b) adequacy
of provision of public services in the Midlands

179
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,949
Engine region; and if she will make a statement.

180
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,209
>>The Prime Minister: Although I will not
speculate on the statement that my right hon.

181
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,970
Friend the Chancellor will make very shortly,
I can assure my hon. Friend that the fundamentals

182
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:40,049
of our economy are strong. Since 2010, employment
in the west midlands has risen by 215,000

183
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,320
and private sector employment alone grew by
80,000 in the past year. We have also seen

184
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,659
schools and police budgets being protected,
and more doctors and nurses in his local hospitals.

185
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,700
>>Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con): And
of course we have also witnessed the post-Brexit

186
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,850
vote of confidence from Nissan, Boeing and
Dyson investing in other parts of the country,

187
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,080
but will my right hon. Friend say a little
bit more about firms like Jaguar Land Rover

188
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,289
in the west midlands?

189
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:13,600
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to say to
my hon. Friend that in the wider sense, of

190
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,950
course, our plans for the midlands engine
show that we want an economy that works for

191
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,620
everyone. We have already confirmed over £330
million in the growth deal funding and money

192
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,840
is going into the midlands engine investment
fund and the Birmingham rail hub, but it is

193
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,940
also important to recognise the investment
that is being made in the UK by companies

194
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,080
like Jaguar Land Rover, which will be building
its new Range Rover model in Solihull. That

195
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,649
is very good news for the west midlands and
also for the British economy. It is a sign

196
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,240
of the confidence that Jaguar Land Rover has
in the UK for the future.

197
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,679
>>Gordon Marsden (Blackpool South) (Lab):
My Blackpool casework is now full of the anxieties

198
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,800
that the DWP and the Home Office are imposing
on vulnerable constituents, including officials’

199
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,660
attempts to overturn tribunal decisions protecting
benefits and residents. That includes a family

200
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:09,440
settled here for eight years and a man with
a severe brain injury. If the Prime Minister

201
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,399
wants people to respect the idea that “Brexit
means Brexit,” should she not respect the

202
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,540
idea that tribunals mean tribunals and not
try to block them with grubby regulations

203
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,090
affecting 164,000 disabled people?

204
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,840
>>The Prime Minister: If the hon. Gentleman
is referring to the decision that has been

205
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,090
taken in relation to the courts and personal
independence payments, as I explained to the

206
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:40,149
House last week, and as has been explained
by the Secretary of State, this is about restoring

207
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:47,730
the system to the state that was intended
when Parliament agreed it. It was agreed by

208
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,289
the coalition Government and by Parliament
after extensive consultation.

209
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:57,840
>>Mark Menzies (Fylde) (Con): In National
Apprenticeship Week, it is important to recognise

210
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,419
this Government’s commitment to investment,
apprenticeships and skills. Will the Prime

211
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,679
Minister look at encouraging a greater commitment
to degree apprenticeships as part of the Government’s

212
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,629
strategy, as championed by businesses in my
constituency such as BAE Systems, which has

213
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:17,679
been at the forefront in developing these
new programmes through its engineering degree

214
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,679
apprenticeship scheme?

215
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,419
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a very important issue. As we look to the

216
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,400
future, we want to ensure that people here
in the UK have the skills they need for the

217
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,971
economy of the future, and degree apprenticeships
will be an important part of that. Companies

218
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:40,059
such as BAE System, which he referred to specifically,
have been right at the forefront of developing

219
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:46,279
these new programmes. I am pleased to say
that the apprenticeship levy will take the

220
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,520
total investment in England to £2.45 billion,
which is double what was spent in 2010. That

221
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,169
means more opportunities for young people
to gain the skills they need for their future.

222
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:03,070
>>Dan Jarvis (Barnsley Central) (Lab): Tomorrow
a memorial will be unveiled to those men and

223
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,259
women who served our country in Afghanistan
and Iraq. Does the Prime Minister agree that

224
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:15,460
we should all pay tribute to their service
and commemorate their sacrifice, not just

225
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,020
with a memorial but with a commitment to learn
from the past and do better in the future?

226
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,860
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
a very important point. The unveiling of the

227
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:34,159
memorial will be a very significant ceremony.
I think that all of us across this House should

228
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:42,070
pay tribute to those recognised by the memorial
for the sacrifice they made—those in our

229
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,340
armed forces and all those civilians who worked
to deliver aid, healthcare and education.

230
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,100
It is important that we recognise the sacrifices
made by our armed forces and also by their

231
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,909
families. That will be a significant moment
tomorrow. We are very clear that we do need

232
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,049
to learn lessons from the past, and that is
exactly what we will do.

233
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,559
>>Johnny Mercer (Plymouth, Moor View) (Con):
I was delighted by the Prime Minister’s

234
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,580
intervention in mental health in January,
which I still feel has not had the attention

235
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,880
it deserves. In Plymouth we are completely
reconfiguring our mental health services,

236
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,140
because we understand that parity of esteem
means nothing without parity of provision.

237
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,780
Will the Prime Minister visit Plymouth to
see some of the pioneering work that we are

238
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,039
doing, perhaps during national Mental Health
Awareness Week in May, when I am hoping that

239
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,990
Plymouth will take a national lead?

240
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,460
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend,
because I know that this is an issue that

241
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,740
he has championed and that is very close to
his area of concern—he has done a lot of

242
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,771
work on mental health. He talks about parity
of esteem, which the Government have introduced,

243
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:53,230
which is very important. More money is going
into mental health provision than ever before.

244
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,580
I would certainly be delighted to see the
work being done in Plymouth, provided my diary

245
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,039
allows for that.

246
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,440
>>Julie Cooper (Burnley) (Lab): In my constituency
of Burnley, primary and secondary schools

247
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,679
are severely underfunded, and maintained nursery
schools are struggling to survive. Why, then,

248
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,679
at a time when we cannot adequately fund the
schools we already have, is the Prime Minister

249
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,049
suggesting spending millions of pounds to
create new grammar schools that will help

250
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,799
only a minority of children? That is unfair
as a new funding formula, and will do nothing

251
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,590
to help social mobility.

252
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,820
>>The Prime Minister: Let us be clear about
what the Government have done. Record amounts

253
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,030
of funding are going into education. It was
a Conservative-led Government that introduced

254
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,110
the pupil premium and it is a Conservative
Government that has protected the core schools

255
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:54,279
budget. The new money that will be going into
schools as a result of today’s announcements

256
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,999
is not about a return to a binary system of
grammar schools and secondary moderns. That

257
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:04,941
is not what we are going to do. What we are
doing is ensuring that there is a diversity

258
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:10,269
of provision—so, yes, some grammar schools,
but also comprehensives, faith schools, university

259
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:16,610
schools and maths schools. I want a good school
place for every child and, more than that,

260
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,929
the right school place for every child.

261
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:25,869
>>Amanda Milling (Cannock Chase) (Con): On
this International Women’s Day, it is absolutely

262
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:31,799
fantastic that we have the highest female
employment rate and the highest percentage

263
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,480
of women on FTSE 100 boards on record, that
the gender pay gap is at the lowest on record,

264
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:56,850
and that we have an amazing female Prime Minister.
However, I am sure the Prime Minister will

265
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,249
agree that there is still much more to do,
particularly in supporting women back to work

266
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:08,929
after a career break. Will my right hon. Friend
outline what more the Government are going

267
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,970
to do to level the playing field?

268
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,869
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for her question. When I stood on the steps

269
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:21,169
of Downing Street back in July and talked
about a country that works for everyone, I

270
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:29,029
meant that. That is why we are taking a number
of measures, including on International Women’s

271
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:35,380
Day today. We are setting up a new fund to
help mothers returning to work after a long

272
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,720
career break. Returnships are important. They
are open to men and women, but we should all

273
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,659
recognise that the majority of those who take
time out of a career are women who devote

274
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,279
themselves to motherhood for a period. Getting
back into employment is often very difficult

275
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,950
for them; they find that it is closed off.
That is why, as well as making economic sense,

276
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,519
it is right and fair for those women that
we provide for returnships to enable them

277
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,749
to get back into the workplace.

278
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:07,539
>>Yasmin Qureshi (Bolton South East) (Lab):
Everyone agrees that early years education

279
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:13,399
is crucial for the welfare and future of our
children. However, nurseries in my constituency

280
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:20,860
tell me that the funding for 30 hours of free
childcare is not sufficient, and many of them

281
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,309
will be forced to close. What steps will the
Prime Minister take to ensure that those nurseries

282
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:27,309
do not close?

283
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:33,320
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady talks
about the 30 hours that is being introduced,

284
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,160
but let us look at what we are doing on childcare.
We have already introduced 15 hours of free

285
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,480
childcare a week for all three and four-year-olds,
15 hours of free childcare a week for disadvantaged

286
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,700
two-year-olds, help with up to 70% of childcare
costs for people on low incomes, and shared

287
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,549
parental leave. We will spend a record £6
billion on childcare support by the end of

288
00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:00,240
this Parliament. That is a Conservative Government,
and it is Conservatives in Government who

289
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,610
have a record of supporting parents with childcare
needs.

290
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,070
>>Alec Shelbrooke (Elmet and Rothwell) (Con):
Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is

291
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,269
indefensible for the Labour police and crime
commissioner in West Yorkshire to be raising

292
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:19,149
the council tax precept when he has £120
million in reserves and underspent this year’s

293
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:21,029
budget by £4 million?

294
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:31,489
>>The Prime Minister: As my hon. Friend knows,
it is of course for the directly elected police

295
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,768
and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire
to decide what to do about the police precept

296
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:37,769
of council tax, as it is in every area that
has a police and crime commissioner, but I

297
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,529
would always encourage those commissioners
to look at ways to introduce efficiencies

298
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:47,769
into their forces before looking to increase
local taxes. Over the past six years, we have

299
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:55,710
seen that police forces can find sensible
savings and reduce crime at the same time.

300
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:02,210
>>Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op):
Mr Speaker, you will know that the Royal College

301
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:08,690
of Physicians has found that 40,000 people
die prematurely each year from diesel pollution,

302
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,850
at a cost of £20 billion to the economy,
and that YouGov has found that 45% of diesel

303
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:21,230
drivers are willing to switch, given the right
scrappage or tax incentive schemes. Will the

304
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:27,350
Prime Minister commit today to a fiscal strategy
and a new clean air Act to put us on a new,

305
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:33,370
cleaner, healthier trajectory and to take
global leadership, rather than being dragged

306
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,859
into the courts to fulfil basic EU air quality
standards?

307
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:42,869
>>The Prime Minister: As the hon. Gentleman
will know, we are looking at the measures

308
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:47,700
that we need to introduce to improve air quality.
There have been improvements in recent years,

309
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,059
but we do need to go further, and that is
what the Government are looking at across

310
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:58,840
Departments, obviously with the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs paying

311
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,850
most attention to that, because that is within
its remit. We will be bringing forward proposals

312
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,639
on air quality in due course.

313
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:11,159
>>Victoria Atkins (Louth and Horncastle) (Con):
International Women’s Day is a chance to

314
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,289
reflect on how Governments and democracies
across the world serve women. Will my right

315
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:26,210
hon. Friend confirm that, when it comes to
female Prime Ministers, it is 2:0 to the Conservatives?

316
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:41,210
>>The Prime Minister: I am grateful to my
hon. Friend for having pointed that out, which

317
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,809
I refrained from doing earlier in response
to questions. I think it is very telling that

318
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,510
the Labour party spends a lot of time talking
about rights for women, giving support to

319
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,960
women and getting women on, whereas it is
the Conservative party that is the party in

320
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,522
this House that has provided two female Prime
Ministers.

321
00:29:57,522 --> 00:30:08,580
>>Deidre Brock (Edinburgh North and Leith)
(SNP): Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking

322
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,269
that any new Scotland Act will be drafted
only after full consultation with the people

323
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:18,299
of Scotland and with the consent of the Scottish
Parliament?

324
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:26,460
>>The Prime Minister: I am not sure whether
the hon. Lady is referring to discussions

325
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,740
that are currently taking place about the
powers that might be available to the devolved

326
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,499
Administrations once we have left the European
Union, but she knows full well that we undertake

327
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:39,090
full discussions with the Scottish Government
on measures that are reserved matters and

328
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,179
on measures where we are negotiating on behalf
of the whole of the United Kingdom.

329
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:50,200
>>Simon Hoare (North Dorset) (Con): Crowdcomms,
a business in my constituency, operates out

330
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,330
of the small market town of Sturminster Newton;
it also has offices in Seattle and Sydney.

331
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:03,450
It employs 24 people, providing high-quality
IT jobs, and it avails itself of high-tech,

332
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:12,080
fast rural broadband and mobile telephone
communication. That is the recipe for growing

333
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,200
our rural economy. Will my right hon. Friend
undertake to ensure that her Government do

334
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,309
all they can to fill the blackspots in our
rural areas?

335
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:25,980
>>The Prime Minister: I can assure my hon.
Friend that we very much want to ensure that

336
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,679
we are doing that. My right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and

337
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,100
Sport is looking at our digital strategy and
ensuring that broadband is available in rural

338
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,419
areas and, indeed, at good speeds in other
areas, which might be less rural than my hon.

339
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,020
Friend’s constituency.

340
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:54,799
>>Mr Speaker: Finally, Mr Tim Farron. [Interruption.]
Order. I do not know whether Members are cheering

341
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,210
because it is “finally” or because of
the popularity of the hon. Gentleman, but

342
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,070
he is going to be heard.

343
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,100
>>Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):
You are all so very and characteristically

344
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
kind.

345
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,590
On International Women’s Day, we stand with
women and girls across the world and note

346
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,809
with resolve that we must not take for granted
the progress we have made towards equality

347
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,870
over the last few decades.

348
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:25,450
Yesterday, we heard that hundreds of families
of soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan

349
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:31,429
have been denied seats at tomorrow’s unveiling
of the memorial to our fallen troops. Inviting

350
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:36,659
a relative of each of those killed in Iraq
and Afghanistan would have taken up fewer

351
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:42,390
than a third of the 2,500 seats at that event.
Will the Prime Minister now apologise to those

352
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:48,580
families for what I assume is a careless oversight
and rectify that mistake immediately so that

353
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,269
bereaved families can come and pay their respects
to their fallen loved ones?

354
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,869
>>The Prime Minister: May I reassure the hon.
Gentleman that charities and groups representing

355
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:02,210
the bereaved were asked to put forward names
of attendees, and we look forward to welcoming

356
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,679
them so that we can publicly acknowledge the
sacrifice that their loved ones made on our

357
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,009
behalf? Over half of those attending tomorrow
are actually current or former members of

358
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:14,669
the armed forces. No one from the bereaved
community has been turned away, and everyone

359
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:19,200
who has applied to attend has been successful,
but I have been reassured that if there are

360
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,570
any bereaved families who wish to attend,
the Ministry of Defence will make every effort

361
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,949
to ensure that they are able to do so.
