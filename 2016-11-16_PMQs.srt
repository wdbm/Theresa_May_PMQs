1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,380
>>Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):
If she will list her official engagements

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,679
for Wednesday 16 November.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,990
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that the whole House will join me

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,590
in expressing our condolences to the families
and friends of the seven people who lost their

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,199
lives and those who were injured in the tragic
tram incident in Croydon last Wednesday. We

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,440
all thank those involved in the rescue operation.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,250
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. In addition to my duties

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,129
in this House, I shall have further such meetings
later today.

9
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:43,530
>>Wendy Morton: Will the Prime Minister join
me in welcoming today’s news that the unemployment

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:52,309
rate has fallen to an 11-year low? Will she
join me in thanking all those businesses that

11
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,879
create jobs, such as Jennifer Ashe &amp; Son,
whose funeral home on Brownhills High Street

12
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,600
in my constituency I was kindly asked to open
last weekend?

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,460
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely agree with
my hon. Friend. I am pleased to say that in

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,369
the last year, employment in her constituency
of Aldridge-Brownhills has gone up by 88,000.

15
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:19,730
It is good to hear of companies that are providing
new jobs. The employment figures show the

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,310
strength of the fundamentals of our economy:
the employment rate has never been higher

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,180
and the unemployment rate is lower than it
has been in more than a decade. I am sure

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,909
that Members from all parts of the House will
welcome yesterday’s news that Google will

19
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,159
create another 3,000 jobs.

20
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:52,250
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): I
concur with the remarks the Prime Minister

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,579
made about the disaster in Croydon last week.
We send our sympathies to all those who lost

22
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,240
loved ones and express our solidarity with
the emergency workers who went through such

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,280
trauma in freeing people from the wreckage.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,910
It appears from press reports that the Chagos
islanders who were expelled from their homes

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,950
over 40 years ago will suffer another injustice
today with the denial of their right of return.

26
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,881
Yesterday, the Foreign Secretary told European
media that Brexit would “probably” mean

27
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:29,650
leaving the customs union. Will the Prime
Minister confirm whether that is the case?

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,290
>>The Prime Minister: I think the right hon.
Gentleman was trying to get two issues in

29
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,160
there. On the issue of the Chagos islanders,
there will be a written ministerial statement

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,230
to the House later today, so everybody will
be able to see the position the Government

31
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,790
are taking.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,950
On the whole issue of the customs union and
the trading relationships we will have with

33
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,980
the European Union and other parts of the
world once we have left the European Union,

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:07,930
we are preparing carefully for the formal
negotiations, but—[Interruption.] We are

35
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,130
preparing carefully for the formal negotiations.
What we want to ensure is that we have the

36
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,840
best possible trading deal with the European
Union once we have left.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,490
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I asked the Prime Minister,
actually, about the Foreign Secretary’s

38
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,210
remarks about leaving the customs union. He
is only a few places down from her. Mr Speaker,

39
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,403
would it be in order for the Foreign Secretary
to come forward and tell us what he actually

40
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:36,730
said? I 
am sure we would all be better informed if

41
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,800
he did.

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:51,170
Earlier this week, a leaked memo said 
that the Government are

43
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:58,340
“considerably short of having a plan for
Brexit…No common strategy has emerged…in

44
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,360
part because of the divisions within the Cabinet.”

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,310
If this memo is, as the Prime Minister’s
press department says, written by ill-informed

46
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:19,340
consultants, will she put the Government’s
plan and common strategy for Brexit before

47
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,339
Parliament?

48
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,650
>>The Prime Minister: I have to say to the
right hon. Gentleman that, yes, we do have

49
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:38,810
a plan. Our plan is to deliver the best possible
deal in trading with and operating within

50
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,410
the European Union. Our plan is to deliver
control of the movement of people from the

51
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,660
European Union into the United Kingdom. Our
plan is to go out there across the world and

52
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,590
negotiate free trade agreements around the
rest of the world. This Government are absolutely

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:07,430
united in their determination to deliver on
the will of the British people and to deliver

54
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,000
Brexit. The right hon. Gentleman’s shadow
Cabinet cannot even decide whether it supports

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brexit.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,600
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Well, the word does not seem
to have travelled very far. I have to say,

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,880
I sympathise with the Italian Government Minister
who said this week, about the Prime Minister’s

58
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Government:

59
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,770
“Somebody needs to tell us something, and
it needs to be something that makes sense.”

60
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:37,530
Is not the truth that the Government are making
a total shambles of Brexit, and nobody understands

61
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,640
what their strategy actually is?

62
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,910
>>The Prime Minister: Of course those in the
European Union whom we will be negotiating

63
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:58,000
with will want us to set out at this stage
every detail of our negotiating strategy.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,390
If we were to do that, it would be the best
possible way of ensuring that we got the worst

65
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,110
result for this country. That is why we will
not do it.

66
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,110
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Talking of worst results,
the Foreign Secretary has been very helpful

67
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,260
this week, because he informed the world that
“Brexit means Brexit”—we did not know

68
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,110
that before—and that

69
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:30,130
“we are going to make a titanic success
of it.”

70
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,900
Taking back control, if that is what Brexit
is to mean—[Interruption.] The Prime Minister

71
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:43,020
is getting advice from the Foreign Secretary
now; can we all hear it? Taking back control

72
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:51,070
clearly requires some extra administration.
Deloitte has spoken, saying:

73
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:57,210
“One Department estimates it needs a 40%
increase in staff to cope with its Brexit

74
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,370
projects”,

75
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:05,080
and that overall expectations are of an increased
headcount of between 10,000 and 30,000 civil

76
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,030
servants. If that estimate is wrong, can the
Prime Minister tell the House exactly how

77
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,430
many extra civil servants will be required
to conduct these negotiations? Her Ministers

78
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,590
need to know—they are desperate for an answer
from her.

79
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,950
>>The Prime Minister: I repeat for the right
hon. Gentleman that we are doing the preparations

80
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,750
necessary for the point at which we will start
the complex formal negotiations with the European

81
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,150
Union. I have set up a Department for Exiting
the European Union, and my right hon. Friend

82
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:46,520
the Secretary of State is doing an excellent
job there in making those preparations.

83
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,669
I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman
that from the confusion that he has on his

84
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:57,260
Benches in relation to the issue of Brexit,
it seems to be yet another example from Labour

85
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,169
of how where they talk, we act. They posture,
we deliver. We are getting on with the job,

86
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,350
he is not up to the job.

87
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:19,690
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Well, Mr Speaker—[Interruption.]
That was exciting, wasn’t it? Mr Speaker—[Interruption.]

88
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:26,830
>>Mr Speaker: Order. There is far too much
noise in the Chamber. I say to the hon. Member

89
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,820
for Kingston and Surbiton (James Berry), calm
yourself, man. You should seek to imitate

90
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,321
the calm and repose of your right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr

91
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:39,340
Clarke), who is setting an example for all
Members of the House.

92
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:51,080
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I do not wish to promote
any further division on their Benches, Mr

93
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,410
Speaker.

94
00:08:52,410 --> 00:09:00,120
These are the most complex set of negotiations
ever undertaken by this country. The civil

95
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,790
service has been cut down to its lowest level
since the second world war. The Prime Minister’s

96
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,370
main focus surely ought to be coming up with
a serious plan. May I ask her to clarify something?

97
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,480
If, when the Supreme Court meets at the beginning
of December, it decides to uphold the decision

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,460
of the High Court, will the Lord Chancellor
this time defend our independent judiciary

99
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,850
against any public attacks?

100
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:35,730
>>The Prime Minister: As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, there have been two cases in the UK

101
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,490
courts on the prerogative power and its use.
The Northern Ireland court found in favour

102
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,020
of the Government; the High Court found against
the Government. We are appealing to the Supreme

103
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,681
Court. We have a good argument, and will put
the case to the Supreme Court. I believe and

104
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:56,200
this Government believe in the independence
of our judiciary, and the judiciary will consider

105
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,760
that decision and come to their judgment on
the basis of the arguments put before them.

106
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,980
But we also believe that our democracy is
underpinned by the freedom of our press.

107
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,830
>>Jeremy Corbyn: My question was on defending
the independence of the judiciary. We should

108
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:20,900
all be doing that. We have an International
Development Secretary who is opposed to overseas

109
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:28,430
aid, a Health Secretary who is running down
our national health service, a Chancellor

110
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,130
with no fiscal strategy, a Lord Chancellor
who seems to have difficulty defending the

111
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:43,070
judiciary, a Brexit team with no plan for
Brexit and, as has just been shown, a Prime

112
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,250
Minister who is not prepared to answer questions
on what the actual Brexit strategy is. We

113
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,910
need a better answer than she has given us.

114
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:01,240
>>The Prime Minister: I will tell the right
hon. Gentleman what we have got. We have an

115
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,720
International Development Secretary delivering
on this Government’s commitment to spend

116
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,860
0.7% of gross national income on international
development, a Health Secretary delivering

117
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,950
on £10 billion of extra funding for the health
service and a Chancellor of the Exchequer

118
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,740
making sure we have the stable economy that
creates the wealth necessary to pay for our

119
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,040
public services. And what we certainly have
got is a Leader of the Opposition who is incapable

120
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,660
of leading.

121
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:41,149
>>Mr John Baron (Basildon and Billericay)
(Con): The Prime Minister understands that

122
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:49,760
we are a one nation party or we are nothing,
something our political opponents consistently

123
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,240
underestimate, to their cost. In the autumn
statement next week will she continue to pursue

124
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,730
that agenda with all the resource and vigour
she can muster, including by increasing significantly

125
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,820
further the personal allowance, so that the
lower paid disproportionately benefit?

126
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,350
>>Fiona Mactaggart (Slough) (Lab): They do
the absolute opposite!

127
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,030
>>Mr Speaker: Order. It is always interesting
to hear the thoughts of the right hon. Member

128
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,930
for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) but they should
not be articulated from a sedentary position

129
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,800
and will have to wait for another occasion.

130
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,910
>>The Prime Minister: Before I answer my hon.
Friend’s question, may I wish his wife all

131
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,060
the very best in the treatment she is going
through at the moment? The thoughts of the

132
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,310
House are with her.

133
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:46,690
My hon. Friend is right. We have a manifesto
commitment to increase the personal allowance.

134
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:55,410
By increasing it from £6,475 in 2010-11 to
£11,000 in 2016-17 and £11,500 next year,

135
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,610
we have cut income tax for more than 30 million
people and have taken 4 million people out

136
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,560
of paying income tax altogether. That is important.
It has helped people at the lower end of the

137
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
income scale.

138
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,040
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): We join the
Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition

139
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,140
in extending our condolences following the
tragedy in Croydon and in paying tribute to

140
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,890
the emergency services.

141
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:26,170
The Institute for Government, which has close
ties to the civil service, has published a

142
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,920
report saying that the UK Government’s approach
towards Brexit is “chaotic and dysfunctional”,

143
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,750
that Brexit poses an “existential threat”
to operations in Whitehall Departments, that

144
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,120
the Prime Minister has a “secretive approach”
towards Brexit, and that the present situation

145
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,140
is “unsustainable”. Does the Prime Minister
plan to carry on like this regardless?

146
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,210
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
will not be surprised when I tell him what

147
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,401
the Government are doing in relation to Brexit.
As I said earlier, the most important thing

148
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:07,830
for the Government to do is calmly and carefully
to get on with the job of preparing for complex

149
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,519
negotiations. One of the most important things
we can do is to make sure that we are not

150
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,459
giving a running commentary on those negotiations
and on our stance, because that would be the

151
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,250
best way to get the worst deal for this country.

152
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:26,560
>>Angus Robertson: On the day we hear that
“post-truth” has become the international

153
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,890
word of the year, we have a running commentary
from the Foreign Secretary. He is prepared

154
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,089
to tell the media in the Czech Republic that
the United Kingdom is likely to leave the

155
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,920
EU customs union post-Brexit, but that it
still wants to trade freely afterwards. In

156
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,610
response, his colleague from the Netherlands
said that that option “doesn’t exist”

157
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,110
and is “impossible”. Both those things
cannot be correct, so will the Prime Minister

158
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,340
confirm today, to Parliament and to the country,
whether the UK is likely to leave the EU customs

159
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,080
union post-Brexit—yes or no?

160
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,191
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
does not actually seem to understand that

161
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:14,110
the customs union is not just a binary decision,
but let us set that to one side. Let us look

162
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,870
at what we need to do: get the best possible
deal for access to, trading with and operating

163
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:29,040
within the single European market. He stands
up time and again in Prime Minister’s questions

164
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,089
and says to me that he wants access to the
single European market. I might remind him

165
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,690
that it was only a couple of years ago that
he wanted to take Scotland out of the single

166
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:53,470
European market by making it independent.
[Interruption.]

167
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:06,269
>>Mr Speaker: Order. [Interruption.] Order.
Mr Docherty-Hughes, you are in a very emotional

168
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:13,010
condition. I normally regard you as a cerebral
denizen of the House. Try to recover your

169
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,020
composure, man!

170
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:20,360
>>James Duddridge (Rochford and Southend East)
(Con): In Southend, crimes such as burglary

171
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,390
and vehicle theft are down, but knife crime
is on the increase, particularly that perpetrated

172
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:32,160
by drug dealers and drug users. Can my right
hon. Friend confirm that this will be a priority

173
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,980
for Her Majesty’s Government? Specifically,
is there anything more that she can do to

174
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,620
help police and crime commissioners such as
Roger Hirst to deal with this very big challenge?

175
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,740
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising an issue that is very important

176
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,240
for everybody in the House. Certainly the
Government will do all they can to support

177
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,290
police and crime commissioners such as Roger
Hirst, who is already doing an excellent job

178
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,910
in Essex. Since 2009, knife crime figures
have fallen overall, but I recognise my hon.

179
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,859
Friend’s concerns. That is why the Home
Office has been supporting police forces such

180
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:14,288
as Essex in conducting weeks of action against
knives under Operation Sceptre. We have legislated

181
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:19,639
to ban dangerous knives, including zombie
knives. We are putting tough sentences in

182
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,998
place and making sure that offenders are punished.
We should send a very clear message that we

183
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,869
will not tolerate knife crime in this country.

184
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:34,690
>>Tommy Sheppard (Edinburgh East) (SNP): Many
people in this country visit the United States

185
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,049
every year to study, on business, or simply
to enjoy one of the greatest countries on

186
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:45,669
earth. What action will the Prime Minister
take if the new President-elect carries through

187
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:52,080
his campaign promise to discriminate against
our citizens on the basis of their religion?

188
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,179
Will she give a commitment that the special
relationship which she believes her Government

189
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:02,059
have with the US presidency will be conducted
on the basis of respect for the dignity of

190
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,470
all our citizens, irrespective of their race
or religion?

191
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,549
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to say to
the hon. Gentleman that our special relationship

192
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,619
with the United States is, I think, very important
to both the United States and the United Kingdom.

193
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,850
We will continue to build on it, as was clear
from the conversation that I had with President-elect

194
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:32,340
Trump shortly after his election, and of course
we want to ensure the dignity of our citizens.

195
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,640
It is up to the United States what rules it
puts in place for entry across its borders,

196
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,269
but we will ensure that the special relationship
continues, and does so in the interests of

197
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,470
both the UK and the US.

198
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,559
>>Andrea Jenkyns (Morley and Outwood) (Con):
Last Tuesday, I attended an infection prevention

199
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,950
and control summit that highlighted the great
work done by the Department of Health, the

200
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:02,130
NHS and other organisations dramatically to
decrease MRSA infection rates, yet also raised

201
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,999
the growing threat of E. coli and sepsis.
Will my right hon. Friend join me in commending

202
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:12,019
such events and outline the Government’s
strategy for combatting superbugs?

203
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:18,440
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely join my
hon. Friend, who raises a very important issue,

204
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,720
in commending such events. It true that the
DOH, Public Health England and the NHS are

205
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,540
doing vital work to decrease infection rates.
We have already seen some very good results—a

206
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:34,289
57% reduction in MRSA bloodstream infections
since 2010 and a 47% reduction in C. diff

207
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,190
infections—but of course there is more to
do, which is why we are setting bold objectives

208
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,169
to halve gram-negative blood infections by
2020, and why last week we announced a new

209
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:48,320
national infection lead to champion and oversee
this effort. This is an important issue and

210
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,000
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising
it.

211
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,470
>>Mr Douglas Carswell (Clacton) (UKIP): Free
trade is vital to our future prosperity, and

212
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,080
Brexit does not mean rejecting globalisation.
Will the Prime Minister ensure that any new

213
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,529
trade deals with the wider world after Brexit
are based on the mutual recognition of standards,

214
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:11,409
not on the kind of over-elaborate, prescriptive,
top-down regulatory regime that underpins

215
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,799
the European single market?

216
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,600
>>The Prime Minister: I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s
support for free trade. He is absolutely right

217
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:26,149
that as we leave the EU we will be looking
for opportunities to develop flexible trading

218
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:31,259
relationships around the world that suit the
United Kingdom. Given the strength of our

219
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,990
economy, I believe that we can go out there
and be a global leader in free trade, and

220
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,440
I welcome his support for that.

221
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,519
>>Chris Philp (Croydon South) (Con): Last
Wednesday, seven people tragically died and

222
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,830
50 were injured in a tram accident in Croydon.
I am sure that the whole House will join the

223
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,869
Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition
and the leader of the SNP in extending our

224
00:20:54,869 --> 00:21:03,210
heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.
Three investigations—by British Transport

225
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,559
Police, the Office of Rail and Road, and the
Rail Accident Investigation Branch—are under

226
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,809
way. Will the Prime Minister assure the House
and the families that any recommendations

227
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,739
to improve safety on trams in Croydon and
across the country that are made by those

228
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:24,070
investigations will be rapidly implemented
by the Government?

229
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:30,259
>>The Prime Minister: I join my hon. Friend
in once again sending our condolences to the

230
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:36,690
families and friends of the seven people who
died in this terrible incident, in expressing

231
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,040
our sympathies for those injured and affected,
and in thanking our emergency services. It

232
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,159
is important that we allow these investigations
to continue and that they can come up with

233
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,720
recommendations in due course; we will, of
course, look very seriously at them. We can

234
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,789
never be complacent about safety and security
regarding such issues, so we need to make

235
00:21:57,789 --> 00:23:17,989
sure that if there are lessons to be learned,
they are 

236
00:23:17,989 --> 00:41:55,509
indeed learned.
