1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:16,859
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
am sure that the whole House will join me

2
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,210
in wishing people across the United Kingdom
and, indeed, the whole world a very happy

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,600
St Andrew’s day.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,789
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others, and in addition to

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,949
my duties in this House I shall have further
such meetings later today.

6
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,570
>>Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green):
May I suggest to the Prime Minister that “having

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,920
your cake and eating it” is not a serious
strategy for Brexit and that Britain deserves

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,510
better that having to rely on leaked documents
to know the Government’s plans? How on earth

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,499
can she expect MPs to vote to trigger article
50 when she refuses to give any clarity on

10
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:56,280
what kind of Brexit she is pursuing and whether
it will involve us still being members of

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,209
the single market? Is it arrogance, or is
it incompetence?

12
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:08,320
>>The Prime Minister: I have answered this
question many times in this House. The hon.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,170
Lady asks specifically about the single market
and trading with the European Union, and I

14
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,979
have been very clear that we are ambitious
in getting the best possible deal for trading

15
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,920
with and operating within the single European
market.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,020
>>Mark Menzies (Fylde) (Con): I welcome last
week’s autumn statement announcement of

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,740
£556 million for infrastructure in the north
of England, but despite that and years of

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,310
hard work, the M55 Lytham St Annes link road
is still not assured. Will my right hon. Friend

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,020
the Prime Minister do everything she can to
ensure that this vital local project for jobs

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,070
and employment in my constituency is delivered
without further delay?

21
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,719
>>The Prime Minister: I commend my hon. Friend
on the hard work he has put in in relation

22
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,369
to this project. I understand that there is
to be a significant sum of funding from a

23
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,780
developer and that my hon. Friend has been
working with the developer and the county

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,160
council on this issue. The local enterprise
partnership has submitted a linked bid to

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,651
Highways England that is being actively considered,
and I understand that my hon. Friend is meeting

26
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:17,940
my right hon. Friend the Minister of State
for Transport this afternoon to discuss this

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,060
in more detail.

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,900
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): May
I join the Prime Minister in wishing everyone

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,010
a very happy St Andrew’s day wherever they
are celebrating it, all around the world?

30
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,620
Last week, the autumn statement revealed the
abject failure of this Government’s economic

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:45,930
strategy. Economic growth was revised down;
wage growth was revised down; business investment

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:54,070
was revised down; and borrowing and debt were
revised up, yet again. Surely, now the Prime

33
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:00,310
Minister accepts that her predecessor’s
long-term economic plan was actually a failure.

34
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,660
>>The Prime Minister: I will give the right
hon. Gentleman some facts. The IMF says that

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,730
this will be the fastest-growing advanced
economy in the world this year. Unemployment

36
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,980
is down. We have record numbers of people
in employment and we have companies such as

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:28,060
Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, Honda, ARM, Google,
Facebook and Apple investing in the UK, securing

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,840
jobs here in the United Kingdom. That is what
a good economic plan does.

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,810
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The Government did tell us
that the deficit would be eradicated by 2015.

40
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:49,330
That was then advanced to 2020, and now it
has been advanced to whenever in the future.

41
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,540
The right hon. Lady quotes the IFS, but she
is being a little selective. It went on to

42
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:03,870
say that the prospect for workers over the
next six years was “dreadful”, creating

43
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,680
“the worst decade for living standards certainly
since the last war and probably since the

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
1920s”.

45
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,310
Is it not fair to say that those who are just
getting by are suffering all the pain for

46
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,750
no gain?

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,810
>>The Prime Minister: Given that the right
hon. Gentleman cannot differentiate between

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:36,210
the IMF and the IFS, it is probably a good
job that he is sitting there and I am standing

49
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:46,650
here. Let me tell him what we are doing for
those people, and let us think about those

50
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,960
people who do find life difficult, who are
struggling to get by, who have a job but worry

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,690
about their job security, who have a home
but worry about paying the mortgage, and who

52
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,810
are worried about their children’s education
and whether their children will be able to

53
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,760
buy a home. What measures have we taken? We
have increased the national living wage. We

54
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,900
introduced the national living wage. We are
increasing personal tax allowance, taking

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,260
more people out of paying tax altogether.
We are increasing the number of affordable

56
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,800
homes being built. But we can only do this
if we have a strong economy, and it is our

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
plan that delivers that strong economy.

58
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,700
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Wages have stagnated; home
ownership is falling; homelessness has doubled;

59
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,280
and queues at food banks are rising every
day. If the Prime Minister really believes

60
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,750
the economy is doing well, why are her Government
forcing through £2 billion of cuts to in-work

61
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,310
support, cutting the incomes of working people
and leaving many households over £2,000 a

62
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,710
year worse off?

63
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,530
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
starts his question by talking about home

64
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,620
ownership. Let us be very clear what is happening
in respect of housing. House building starts

65
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:11,419
fell by 45% under Labour in 12 years. They
have increased by over two thirds since the

66
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,840
Conservatives were in government. Yes, we
are making changes to the welfare system.

67
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,750
He and I have a fundamental difference of
opinion about the welfare system. I think

68
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,400
what is important in the welfare system is
that we remember those who are benefiting

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,370
from it and we remember those who are paying
for it. The universal credit system is there

70
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:43,420
to ensure that work will always pay. I believe
in a welfare system that does help people

71
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,340
to get into work, that does encourage people
into the workplace. He believes in a welfare

72
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,400
system where people are able to live on benefits.

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,170
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The last Labour Government
took 800,000 children out of poverty. Under

74
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,761
the right hon. Lady’s Government, child
poverty is rising and now covers 4 million

75
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:07,760
children across this country. Our people are
suffering because of the policies of her Government.

76
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,590
People are paying the price for her failed
economic experiment. The Government have even

77
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,580
now abandoned the previous Chancellor’s
pledge that their so-called national living

78
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,310
wage would be paying at least £9 per hour
by 2020. What is the new pledge on living

79
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,470
wage?

80
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,760
>>The Prime Minister: The pledge on living
wage is set out in the autumn statement and

81
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:42,419
is as it always has been. The right hon. Gentleman
talks about poverty. Actually, we are seeing

82
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,930
fewer families in absolute poverty and fewer
families in relative poverty. I come back

83
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,350
to the point I have been making in answer
to his previous questions: it is only possible

84
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:03,240
to do these things by having a strong economy.
The one thing we know is that the policy that

85
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:16,350
would not deliver a strong economy is Labour’s
policy to increase borrowing by £500 billion.

86
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:26,260
He talks about the impact on people in work.
Let me remind him what the former shadow Treasury

87
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,860
Minister said: Labour’s policy to increase
borrowing would lead to double the income

88
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,129
tax, double council tax, double VAT and double
national insurance. That will not help anybody

89
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,219
who is in the workplace and just about managing.

90
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,399
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I am not entirely sure where
the Government’s credibility lies on borrowing,

91
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:56,019
since they are borrowing even more, the deficit
is increasing and people are suffering. When

92
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:01,600
the Prime Minister talks about children in
poverty in response to my question, I simply

93
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,129
remind her 4 million children are living in
poverty—children going hungry to school

94
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,800
in this country because their parents do not
have enough money to feed them properly. It

95
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,670
is a disgrace and should be addressed.

96
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,540
In the autumn statement last week, the Chancellor
spoke for over 50 minutes. During that time,

97
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,339
he did not once mention the national health
service or social care. Some 1.2 million people

98
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:34,529
are lacking the care they need. Why was there
not one single penny more for social care

99
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,089
in the autumn statement?

100
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,760
>>The Prime Minister: There is absolutely
no doubt that the social care system is under

101
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,949
pressure; we recognise that. If we just look
at the fact that there are 1 million more

102
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:57,720
people aged over 65 today than there were
in 2010, we see the sort of pressures on the

103
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,980
social care system. That is why the Government
have already acted to put more money into

104
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,869
the social care system: more money through
the better care fund—£3.5 billion extra

105
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:11,079
through the better care fund—and more money
through the social care precept. But it is

106
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:18,790
also important that local authorities and
the NHS work together to ensure, for example,

107
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,990
that people have the social care they need,
so they are not ending up blocking beds in

108
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,550
hospital. There is some very good practice
up and down the country, and sadly there is

109
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,769
some not so good practice. What we need to
do is make sure everybody is giving the best

110
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,059
possible service to people who need it.

111
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,240
>>Jeremy Corbyn: There is a tragic parallel
going on between an underfunded NHS and an

112
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,389
underfunded social care system all over the
country, and the Prime Minister knows it.

113
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,029
Indeed, she might care to listen to the Tory
leader of Warwickshire Council, Izzi Seccombe,

114
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,420
who says that her council has been “cut
to the bone”, and who says on social care:

115
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,879
“right now we have a £1.3 billion gap which
is not being funded.”

116
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,990
It is a real crisis in every social services
department all over the country and, indeed,

117
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,110
in almost every NHS hospital.

118
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:13,480
Next year, this Government are handing back
£605 million in corporation tax cuts, rising

119
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,990
to £1.6 billion the year after that and £7.5
billion over the next five years. So could

120
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,699
the Prime Minister explain to the more than
1 million elderly people not getting the care

121
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:31,660
they need, to the 4 million people on NHS
waiting lists and to the millions of pensioners

122
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,350
worried about losing the protection of the
triple lock why there is not one penny extra

123
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,430
for the NHS or social care? Just what is this
Government’s real sense of priorities?

124
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,920
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
talks about funding social care and funding

125
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,269
the national health service: £3.8 billion
extra is going into the national health service

126
00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:11,379
this year. Under Labour’s plans, we would
have seen £1.3 billion less going into the

127
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:17,040
national health service. Social care funding
is going up under this Government. At the

128
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,839
last election, the shadow Chancellor—lately
of “Strictly” fame—said local authorities

129
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,480
would get not a penny more. Conservatives
are putting money into the NHS and social

130
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,320
care—Labour would deny it.

131
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:43,009
>>Seema Kennedy (South Ribble) (Con): On a
cross-party basis, Jo Cox and I were establishing

132
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,790
the National Commission on Loneliness when
she was brutally murdered. This work is now

133
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,059
being continued by the hon. Member for Leeds
West (Rachel Reeves) and me. Does my right

134
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:58,199
hon. Friend agree that loneliness is an issue
for all our communities, and will she urge

135
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,410
her Ministers to engage with the commission
as it carries out its work and reports next

136
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,410
year?

137
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,560
>>The Prime Minister: First of all, may I
just say that I am sure the whole House would

138
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,110
want to join me in commending Jo’s family
for the very dignified way in which they dealt

139
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,449
with matters as the court case was going through.
It must have been very harrowing for them.

140
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:24,461
I am very pleased that my hon. Friend and
the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)

141
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:28,559
are taking forward the work of the commission
on loneliness. Earlier this week I was able

142
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,839
to support the “Good Morning Britain”
1 Million Minutes campaign, which is encouraging

143
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,430
individuals to give 30 minutes of their time
to help—to be with—somebody who is lonely.

144
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,850
We have, over the years, I think, failed to
understand the impact that loneliness has

145
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,820
on people’s psychological health but also
their physical health. Ministers will look

146
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,749
forward to receiving the results from the
commission and to working with my hon. Friend

147
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,749
and others.

148
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:59,899
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): A very happy
St Andrew’s day to everybody celebrating

149
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:09,860
in Scotland and throughout the world.

150
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,829
There is literally nothing to celebrate about
the humanitarian catastrophe befalling the

151
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:22,589
people of Syria at this time. The situation
in the besieged city of Aleppo is described

152
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,040
as so bad that it

153
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:30,060
“could be one of the biggest massacres of
civilian population since World War II”.

154
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,739
What can the UK and the international community
do to end the suffering of the people of Syria?

155
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:39,760
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
is right to draw attention to the appalling

156
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,019
situation in Syria, and particularly the indiscriminate
attacks that we see on civilians in Aleppo.

157
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:53,329
The United Kingdom has been working with France
to bring forward an emergency discussion on

158
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,610
this issue at the UN Security Council; that
will take place later today. We want to see

159
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,299
a cessation of hostilities. We want to see
an opportunity for humanitarian aid to have

160
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,579
access to Aleppo, and we will be pressing
for that at the Security Council.

161
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:12,990
>>Angus Robertson: It is extremely welcome
that the discussions are taking place in the

162
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,139
United Nations, and we wish success to all
those who are supporting a humanitarian solution

163
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:23,829
to the crisis. However, things are so bad
that the agencies are saying that in Aleppo

164
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:30,869
the situation is a “descent into hell”.
Time is absolutely of the essence. I know

165
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:34,619
the Prime Minister is seized of this matter;
we are in agreement. Can I please appeal to

166
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:41,009
her: can absolutely everything be done now
to alleviate the situation of the poor people

167
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,939
of Aleppo and of Syria?

168
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:49,209
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
is right about the horrific situation in Aleppo.

169
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,709
I can assure him that the Government are pressing
hard and we are doing everything that we can

170
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,810
in relation to this. We have consistently
looked at what the possible solutions might

171
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,850
be, to see whether there are other avenues
that we can press for. I think the Security

172
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,199
Council debate is very important. There is
an important message to send to Russia: that

173
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,209
it use its influence with the Assad regime
to stop these appalling atrocities in Aleppo

174
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,069
and let humanitarian aid through.

175
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:18,129
>>Fiona Bruce (Congleton) (Con): Comments
this week by the equalities commissioners

176
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:24,490
about not being worried about talking about
Christmas at work were important, because

177
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:31,040
many Christians are now worried, even fearful,
about mentioning their faith in public. Will

178
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,350
the Prime Minister therefore join me in welcoming
the recent Lawyers’ Christian Fellowship

179
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,699
publication “Speak Up!”, which confirms
that in our country the legal rights of freedom

180
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,259
of religion and freedom of speech to speak
about one’s faith responsibly, respectfully

181
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,560
and without fear are as strong today as ever?

182
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,379
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue which matters both to her

183
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,089
and me. I think the phrase that was used by
the Lawyers’ Christian Fellowship was “the

184
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,169
jealously guarded principle” of that ability
to speak freely, as she says, respectfully

185
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,012
and responsibly about one’s religion. I
am happy to welcome the publication of this

186
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:14,089
report and its findings. Of course, we are
now into the season of Advent. We have a very

187
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,909
strong tradition in this country of religious
tolerance and freedom of speech, and our Christian

188
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:23,790
heritage is something we can all be proud
of. I am sure we would all want to ensure

189
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:30,120
that people at work do feel able to speak
about their faith, and also feel able to speak

190
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,909
quite freely about Christmas.

191
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:39,059
>>Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab): Thirty years
ago, I conducted my first funeral as a young

192
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:46,799
curate. It was for a young teenage boy who
was an enormous fan of Paul Simon, so, as

193
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,130
the crematorium curtains closed, we listened
to “The Sound of Silence”, and many people

194
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,809
cried. The average cost of a child’s funeral
today is £3,675. Some councils do not charge

195
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,600
anything, but some charge a lot, and the social
fund is means-tested. I ask again: will the

196
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,990
Prime Minister please listen to the words
of my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea East

197
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,580
(Carolyn Harris), sign up to her campaign
and put an end to both the means-testing and

198
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,990
the postcode lottery, so that no parents who
lose a child have to deal with the fear of

199
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,980
hardship as well as their grief?

200
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,159
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman raises
a very important point. I know that the hon.

201
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,440
Member for Swansea East (Carolyn Harris) spoke
very movingly from personal experience in

202
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:40,100
the debate that she called on this issue.
I do not think that anybody who has not been

203
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
through the death of a child can possibly
understand the pain that that brings, not

204
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,970
just immediately but thereafter, as parents
see others grow up while their child will

205
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,970
not.

206
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,649
I recognise the issue that the hon. Gentleman
has raised about the cost of children’s

207
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:03,200
funerals. As he has said, there are measures
in place for families who have particular

208
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,899
hardship cases, where money can be given.
It is open to local authorities to waive fees,

209
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,770
and some local authorities do that. We have
left this as a decision for local authorities,

210
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,389
and some do, indeed, waive those fees.

211
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:23,260
>>Kelly Tolhurst (Rochester and Strood) (Con):
Grammar schools across the Medway towns have

212
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,690
provided good education and opportunities
for hard-working young people from a range

213
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,730
of backgrounds, helping social mobility and
intervening to improve recent Ofsted results

214
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,720
in local primary schools, particularly in
Rochester and Strood. Does my right hon. Friend

215
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,480
agree that our current grammar schools’
contribution to education ought to be valued

216
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,870
and given every support, as part of the educational
mix up and down the country, to help children

217
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,980
to achieve their full potential?

218
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,559
>>The Prime Minister: I agree with my hon.
Friend. I believe that there are now nearly

219
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,730
11,000 more children in good and outstanding
schools in my hon. Friend’s area than there

220
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,809
were in 2010. We want to provide a good school
place for every child. She references the

221
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,970
good work being done by grammar schools in
her area to improve the quality of education

222
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:20,039
in primary schools, which is one of the issues
that we are looking at in our consultation

223
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,659
on education. We want to remove the legal
ban on expanding or opening new grammar schools,

224
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,390
but we also want to see grammar schools working
to improve standards across the education

225
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,460
system generally.

226
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,929
>>Margaret Greenwood (Wirral West) (Lab):
The sustainability and transformation plan

227
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:39,519
for Cheshire and Merseyside aims to develop
accountable care organisations. It is a model

228
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,610
from America, where it is used to deliver
private, insurance-based healthcare. Can the

229
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,779
Prime Minister assure me that STPs will not
be used as a means of introducing insurance-based

230
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,230
private healthcare into the NHS?

231
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,820
The Prime Minister
The STPs are about local people determining

232
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,890
the shape of health services in a local area,
to deliver the best service for local people.

233
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,190
Obviously, every area will be looking very
closely at the plans that are being brought

234
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,730
forward. It is important that we see, in those
STPs, health services increasingly working

235
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,600
with local authorities to ensure that they
are providing the right, holistic level of

236
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,889
care for people in their area.

237
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:31,009
>>Claire Perry (Devizes) (Con): As the Prime
Minister leads us towards a smart and smooth

238
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:37,830
Brexit—as I like to call it, a “smexit”—I
am sure she shares my view that the flexibility

239
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,429
of Britain’s labour market is one of this
country’s great strengths. However, she

240
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,720
will be aware that the growth of new business
models as part of the so-called gig economy

241
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,149
is causing real concern that employment rights
could be eroded. Indeed, the news that Uber

242
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:57,160
is seeking a licence to operate in my constituency
has left local people concerned about what

243
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,720
their jobs could look like in the future.
What reassurances can the Prime Minister give

244
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,139
to me and my constituents that the Government
are working to make sure that employment rights

245
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:10,529
and employment regulations keep pace with
this sort of innovation?

246
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:16,490
>>The Prime Minister: As I mentioned earlier,
we have seen a significant rise in the number

247
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,970
of people in employment in this country, and
that is because we have got the strong economy

248
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,880
that we have. However, I recognise that employment
and types of employment are changing. Technology

249
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,910
is the driver in many cases. That is why I
have asked the chief executive of the RSA,

250
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,740
Matthew Taylor, to conduct a review of and
report on modern employment practices, so

251
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,590
we can ensure that the legislative framework
is absolutely the right one for the economy

252
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,720
of the future and the jobs of the future.
That shows that it is now the Conservative

253
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,570
party that is the party of working people.

254
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:03,049
>>Stephen Timms (East Ham) (Lab): The Conservative
election manifesto promised to halve the disability

255
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:10,399
employment gap by 2020. Ministers justified
their plan to cut the benefit from next April

256
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:16,539
by promising to recycle some of the savings
into improving employment support for benefit

257
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:21,510
claimants. It has now become apparent that
funding for employment support is not being

258
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:28,039
increased; it is being cut. The target for
halving the gap—2020—has been completely

259
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,970
abandoned. Surely the only honourable course
now is for the Government to abandon the benefit

260
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,970
cut as well.

261
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,330
>>The Prime Minister: I am very pleased to
say that, over the past three years, nearly

262
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,629
600,000 more disabled people have got into
the workplace. I think that is very important.

263
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:48,809
Of course, we want to ensure that all those
disabled people who are able to get into work

264
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:54,710
are given the support needed to do that. That
is why we have been ensuring not just that

265
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,860
this is about benefits, but that this is about
the support package in total that people are

266
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,270
given. They do have individual support through
the personal independence payment for the

267
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,789
particular long-terms costs that they have
incurred because of their disability. It is

268
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,890
also the support package that is provided
to people in the work group in employment

269
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:17,370
and support allowance that enables them to
get into work. Nearly 600,000 more disabled

270
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,269
people in work—that is something the right
hon. Gentleman should be celebrating.

271
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:26,629
>>Mr Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden)
(Con): I welcome my right hon. Friend’s

272
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:33,350
eagerness to give EU citizens living and working
lawfully in this country the assurance that

273
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:41,090
they will be able to remain here after Brexit
and to obtain reassurances for British citizens

274
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:48,159
living and working in the EU. Does she therefore
share my disappointment that Mr Tusk, in response

275
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,580
to a letter from 80 Members of this House
about resolving this issue speedily, has intransigently

276
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,790
put EU processes ahead of common humanity?

277
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:06,120
>>The Prime Minister: I can assure my right
hon. Friend that, as I said earlier, I would

278
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,710
hope this is an issue we can look at at an
early stage in the negotiations, and off course

279
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,950
there will be two years of negotiations. I
think it is right that we want to give reassurance

280
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,760
to British citizens living in the EU and to
EU citizens living here in the UK, but I think

281
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,649
the reaction that we have seen shows why it
was absolutely right for us not to do what

282
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,910
the Labour party wanted us to do, which was
simply to give away the guarantee for rights

283
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,990
of EU citizens here in the UK. As we have
seen, that would have left UK citizens in

284
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,149
Europe high and dry.

285
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:43,520
>>Mr Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow) (Lab): I know
the Prime Minister is handed happy briefs

286
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,050
to read out, but can I tell her that she has
been wrong on the national health service

287
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:55,850
for weeks now? If she came to South Tyneside
hospital, she would see services closing,

288
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,800
she would see patients worried and she would
see staff demoralised, so when is she going

289
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,789
to get a grip of those bean counters who are
committing criminal damage on the people’s

290
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,279
cherished service in her name?

291
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:19,179
>>The Prime Minister: There are nearly 30
more doctors and over 950 more nurses in the

292
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:26,500
South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust compared
with 2010. This year, the South Tyneside clinical

293
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:34,330
commissioning group will be getting increased
funding. Health funding in the hon. Gentleman’s

294
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:42,591
area is going to be £2.7 billion this year,
and that will be increasing by 2020-21. It

295
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:46,840
is this Government that are putting more money
into the national health service; it is the

296
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,210
Labour party—a former shadow Health Secretary
from the Labour party—who said that more

297
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,960
money for the NHS was “irresponsible”.

298
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,830
>>Chris White (Warwick and Leamington) (Con):
Warwick and Leamington contains many of the

299
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:07,320
elements of a successful industrial strategy—great
schools, a skilled workforce, strong infrastructure,

300
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,150
manufacturing, creative industries and being
surrounded by world-class research and development

301
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,830
facilities, to name but a few. Will the Prime
Minister outline the Government’s progress

302
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,450
in developing this policy, which is so important
to our nation’s prosperity?

303
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:28,629
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right in what he says about his own constituency

304
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:34,620
and the midlands engine in relation to the
development of jobs and for the strong economy

305
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,809
of the future. That is why we will be developing
the industrial strategy for the whole of the

306
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,679
United Kingdom, which is an important part
of the Government’s plan for the future.

307
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,940
It is looking at issues such as infrastructure
and skills, ensuring that we can build on

308
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,639
the best and encourage the growth that we
need for the economy of the future. The midlands

309
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,809
engine and the part of the country that my
hon. Friend represents will be an important

310
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,450
part of that growth for the future.

311
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,629
>>Kirsten Oswald (East Renfrewshire) (SNP):
Guests from the Hyderabad diocese have twice

312
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,020
been refused visas to visit the Church of
Scotland presbytery of Glasgow as part of

313
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,090
a twinning initiative, the suggestion being
that the visit was not genuine, despite the

314
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,740
paperwork being correct and the Church bearing
the costs. When I raised this with the Leader

315
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,010
of the House, he spoke of the need for people
to return home after visits, and then the

316
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:26,880
Immigration Minister told me in a patronising
letter how to apply for a visa. Will the Prime

317
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,600
Minister tell the Church why its visitors
are not welcome and what messages she thinks

318
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,270
it sends to our faith communities?

319
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:41,330
>>The Prime Minister: We have a very clear
visa system, and decisions are taken according

320
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,960
to its rules, but as the hon. Lady will have
seen, the Home Secretary has heard her comments.

321
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,570
I suggest that if she sends her the details,
she will look at the case.

322
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,950
>>Suella Fernandes (Fareham) (Con): Does my
right hon. Friend agree that, once the will

323
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,450
of the British people, including the residents
of Fareham, is delivered and we break free

324
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:10,480
from the shackles of the EU, Britain stands
to benefit from the fantastic opportunity

325
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,070
to forge new trade deals with countries such
as India and the USA, and will she meet me

326
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:21,700
and members of the Legatum Institute special
trade commission, which has projected a 50%

327
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,490
increase in global world product over 15 years
as a result of Brexit, which will enable trade

328
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,519
to boost jobs, growth and hope?

329
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,389
>>The Prime Minister: I am interested in the
results of the Legatum Institute commission’s

330
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:40,899
report on this issue. I believe absolutely
that free trade is the right way to go—it

331
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:45,299
is through free trade that we increase growth
and prosperity—which is why I have said

332
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,990
I want this country to be a global leader
in free trade and why we will not just look

333
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:58,129
to forge new trade deals with other countries
as we leave the EU but see how we can improve

334
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,580
trade with other countries before we leave
it, so that we will continue to strengthen

335
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,970
our economy. I am sure that the Secretary
of State for International Trade will be happy

336
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,149
to meet my hon. Friend to discuss the results
of the commission’s report.

337
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:14,580
>>Mr Speaker: I warmly welcome the hon. Member
for Blyth Valley (Mr Campbell) back to his

338
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
place.

339
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,679
>>Mr Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley) (Lab):
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I’ll be able to tell

340
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,210
you more about it next week, when I meet my
consultant.

341
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:33,440
What plans does the Prime Minister have to
make super-economic zones? The Blyth estuary

342
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,600
was given an economic zone by the last Tory
Chancellor, as we have acres and acres of

343
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,710
land around that river. I hope that that is
in her mind.

344
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,990
>>The Prime Minister: I join you, Mr Speaker,
and others in welcoming the hon. Gentleman

345
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,179
to his place. It is good to see him back in
his usual position, and I wish him all the

346
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:55,679
very best.

347
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,509
As part of our industrial strategy, we are
looking around the country at where there

348
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:06,820
are opportunities for economic growth and
how we can encourage them to be taken up.

349
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:14,899
It is important that economic growth and prosperity
be spread across the whole country to ensure

350
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,799
an economy that works for everyone.

351
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:25,850
>>Stuart Andrew (Pudsey) (Con): The digital
and creative industry is an important part

352
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:33,220
of the UK economy, and Leeds is an important
hub in the sector. In welcoming the £1 billion

353
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,370
investment in better broadband in the autumn
statement, may I urge my right hon. Friend

354
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,309
to ensure that Yorkshire gets its fair share,
so that we can build on this success and make

355
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,470
Leeds the capital of this industry?

356
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,960
>>The Prime Minister: I assure my hon. Friend
that I recognise the role played by the creative

357
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,419
and digital industries in our economy, the
excellent example of Leeds and the vibrancy

358
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:03,070
they bring to the economy there. I am pleased
that we are able to invest a further £1 billion

359
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,909
in gold standard broadband, which will bring
better connections to 2 million more homes

360
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,139
and businesses, and I am sure that Yorkshire
will have a very central role to play in this.

361
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:18,029
>>Mr David Lammy (Tottenham) (Lab): Yesterday,
the Prime Minister’s Government published

362
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:25,369
a Green Paper on corporate governance, emphasising
the importance of gender and race diversity.

363
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:31,040
I congratulate her on that, but why has her
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and

364
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,869
Sport blocked the appointment of a black woman
to the Channel 4 board? Does she not think

365
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:42,320
there is a woman or a black person in the
country worthy of being on the board of Channel

366
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
4?

367
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:51,260
>>The Prime Minister: I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for the welcome he has given to

368
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,220
the corporate governance Green Paper that
we have produced, which of course covers a

369
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,990
great deal more than simply issues of gender
and diversity in corporate governance and

370
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:07,850
on corporate boards. I am not aware of the
particular case that he mentioned. In looking

371
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,249
at public appointments, however, I would say
that a very careful process is undertaken

372
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,789
to ensure that the people who are appointed
have the skillset and the requirements needed

373
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:24,090
to carry out the role. I will look into the
issue he raised, but this is always a question

374
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:32,559
of the right person for the job. Issues around
the sort of question that he has raised do

375
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,610
not come into it; it is about who is right
for the job.

376
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,810
>>Michael Tomlinson (Mid Dorset and North
Poole) (Con): Mr Donald Tusk’s response

377
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,380
to my letter on reciprocal rights has already
been mentioned. I congratulate the Prime Minister

378
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,750
on her work with individual member states
in this important matter, but does she share

379
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,210
our disappointment and will she join me in
calling for this important matter to be raised

380
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,279
in two weeks’ time at the next European
Council meeting?

381
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,149
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the concerns
of my hon. Friend and other Members on the

382
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:08,560
particular issue of the rights of EU citizens
and UK citizens variously living here in the

383
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,140
UK and in the other member states of the European
Union. I hope it is something that we will

384
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,729
be able to address at an early stage. We have
not yet triggered article 50 and the negotiations

385
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:27,250
will have up to two years to run, as set out
in the Lisbon treaty. As I say, I hope we

386
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,220
will be able to address this at an early stage
to give people the reassurance they need.

387
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:36,819
>>Hannah Bardell (Livingston) (SNP): A year
ago this week, my constituent Deborah Pearson

388
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,270
lost her niece Julie, who is believed to have
been unlawfully killed in Eilat, Israel. A

389
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,460
year ago, the Prime Minister’s predecessor
was good enough to give me support, as was

390
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,870
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but after
a year of writing letters, having meetings

391
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,340
and putting pressure on the Israeli authorities,
the family is no closer to having justice

392
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,860
for Julie. Will the Prime Minister meet me
and my constituent to understand what further

393
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,910
pressure can be brought to bear so that the
family can get answers and understand who

394
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,440
brought this terrible crime against their
family member?

395
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,200
>>The Prime Minister: I understand the concern
that the hon. Lady rightly shows for her constituent,

396
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,940
and obviously her constituent’s deep concern
to find out what happened in this terrible

397
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,050
tragedy. I understand that the appropriate
Minister in the Foreign Office is actively

398
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:26,640
working on this question. I will ask him to
respond to the hon. Lady and to meet her to

399
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,640
discuss what more can be done and to set out
exactly what the Foreign Office is doing on

400
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,300
this issue.
