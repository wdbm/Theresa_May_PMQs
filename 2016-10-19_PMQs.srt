1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,179
>>The Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May): I
know the whole House will wish to join me

2
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,130
in remembering all those who lost their lives
and were affected by the Aberfan disaster

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:29,419
50 years ago this week. It claimed the lives
of 144 people, the vast majority of them children.

4
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:35,450
It caused devastation to the local community.
It is right that we pause and reflect on this

5
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,870
important anniversary, and recognise the solidarity
and resilience of the people of Aberfan to

6
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,710
overcome this powerful tragedy.

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,420
This morning I had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and others. I will have further

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,390
such meetings later today, in addition to
my duties in this House.

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,690
>>Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con): May
I associate myself with the remarks of the

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,320
Prime Minister? I am of an age that I can
remember the terrible black and white film

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,962
of this tragedy. It affected everyone. We
in this House pass on our thoughts to the

12
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,270
people of Aberfan today.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,340
Mr Speaker, as you might know it is my birthday
today. The Prime Minister has already given

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,149
me a huge birthday present by letting everyone
know that we will be out of the European Union

15
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:33,880
no later than 31 March 2019. May I press her
for another present? Her excellent policy

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:44,850
of closing Victorian prisons and opening modern
ones is spot-on. Will she support the reopening

17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,539
of Wellingborough prison as part of this excellent
programme, or would she rather just sing happy

18
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,060
birthday?

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,679
>>The Prime Minister: I am very happy to wish
my hon. Friend a very happy birthday today:

20
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,759
many happy returns! I hope that Mrs Bone is
going to treat the occasion in an appropriate

21
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:13,870
manner. [Laughter.]

22
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:30,980
>>Mr Speaker: Order. I want to hear what is
coming next.

23
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:45,750
>>The Prime Minister: Calm down, Mr Speaker.
On the serious issue about prisons, I welcome

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,099
the fact that my hon. Friend applauds the
policy we are following of closing out-of-date

25
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:56,540
prisons and building new ones. I hear the
lobbying he has made for Wellingborough, and

26
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,590
I can assure him that Wellingborough is one
of the sites that is being considered. The

27
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,519
Secretary of State will look at the issue
very carefully and make an announcement in

28
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,860
due course.

29
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:15,280
>>Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) (Lab): I
join the Prime Minister in commemorating the

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,430
disaster at Aberfan all those years ago when
118 children along with many adults died.

31
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,550
Many in that community are still living with
that tragedy, and they will live with it for

32
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,760
the rest of their days. As a young person
growing up at that time, I remember it well,

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,709
particularly the collections for the disaster
fund. The BBC documentary presented by Huw

34
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,530
Edwards was brilliant and poignant, and serves
to remind us all of what the disaster was

35
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,450
about.

36
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,880
One in four of us will suffer a mental health
problem. Analysis by the King’s Fund suggests

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,520
that 40% of our mental health trusts had their
budgets cut last year, and six trusts have

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,630
seen their budgets cut for three years in
a row. Is the Prime Minister really confident

39
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,349
that we are delivering parity of esteem for
mental health?

40
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:11,540
>>The Prime Minister: First, like the right
hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member

41
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,219
for Wellingborough (Mr Bone), I am of an age
when I can remember seeing on television those

42
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,700
terrible scenes of what happened in Aberfan.
I did not see the whole of Huw Edwards’

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,259
documentary, but I thought the bits that I
happened to see last night were very poignant,

44
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:32,040
as the right hon. Gentleman said. Interestingly,
what it showed again was the issue of those

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,470
in power not being willing to step up to the
plate initially and to accept what had actually

46
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:47,449
happened, but the inquiry was very clear about
where the responsibility lay.

47
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,380
It is right that we are introducing parity
of esteem for mental health in our national

48
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,220
health service. We have waited too long for
this, and it is important that it is being

49
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,530
done. We are actually investing more in mental
health services—an estimated record £11.7

50
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,530
billion. In particular, we are increasing
the overall number of children’s beds to

51
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,310
the highest number for mental health problems,
which I think is important. There is, of course,

52
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,160
more for us to do in looking at mental health,
but we have made an important start and, as

53
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,250
I say, that funding will be there.

54
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:28,520
>>Jeremy Corbyn: I received a letter from
Colin, who has a family member with a chronic

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,139
mental health condition. Many others, like
him, have relatives going through a mental

56
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:39,099
health crisis. He says that the “NHS is
so dramatically underfunded” that too often

57
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,699
it is left to the underfunded police forces
to deal with the consequences of this crisis.

58
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,729
Indeed, the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall
has this month threatened legal action against

59
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,550
the NHS because he is forced to hold people
with mental conditions in police cells because

60
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,180
there are not enough NHS beds. I simply ask
the Prime Minister this: if the Government

61
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,970
are truly committed to parity of esteem, why
is this trust and so many others facing an

62
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,310
acute financial crisis at the present time?

63
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,699
>>The Prime Minister: May I first of all say
to Colin that I think all of us in this House

64
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,690
recognise the difficulties people have when
coping with mental health problems? I commend

65
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,450
those in this House who have been prepared
to stand up and refer to their own mental

66
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,060
health problems. I think that has sent a very
important signal to people with mental health

67
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
issues across the country.

68
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,901
The right hon. Gentleman raises the whole
question of the interaction between the NHS

69
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:41,250
and police forces. I am very proud of the
fact that when I was Home Secretary I actually

70
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,639
worked with the Department of Health to bring
a change to the way in which police forces

71
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,669
dealt with people in mental health crisis.
That is why we see those triage pilots out

72
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,409
on the streets and better NHS support being
given to police forces, so that the number

73
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:06,639
of people who have to be taken to a police
cell as a place of safety has come down. Overall,

74
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,099
I think it has more than halved, and in some
areas it has come down by even more than that.

75
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,270
This is a result of the action that this Government
have taken.

76
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,660
>>Jeremy Corbyn: The reality is that no one
with a mental health condition should ever

77
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,770
be taken to a police cell. Such people should
be supported in the proper way, and I commend

78
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,130
the police and crime commissioners who have
managed to end the practice in their areas.

79
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,479
The reality is, however, that it is not just
Devon and Cornwall that are suffering cuts;

80
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,699
the Norfolk and Suffolk mental health trust
has been cut in every one of the last three

81
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,699
years.

82
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,620
I agree with the Prime Minister that it is
a very good thing for Members to stand up

83
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,280
and openly discuss mental health issues that
they have experienced, because we need to

84
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,930
end the stigma surrounding mental health conditions
throughout the country. However, NHS trusts

85
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,949
are in a financial crisis. According to NHS
Providers, it seems to be the worst financial

86
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:10,650
crisis in NHS history: 80% of acute hospitals
are now in deficit. There was a time, in 2010,

87
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,870
when the NHS was in surplus. What has happened?

88
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:21,430
>>The Prime Minister: Let me remind the right
hon. Gentleman what has happened in relation

89
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:28,960
to NHS funding. We asked the NHS itself to
come up with a five-year plan, and we asked

90
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,060
the NHS itself to say what extra funding was
needed to deliver on that. The NHS came up

91
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,629
with its five-year plan, led by Simon Stevens
as its chief executive. He said that £8 billion

92
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:49,000
was needed. We are giving £10 billion of
extra funding to the NHS. I might also remind

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,130
the right hon. Gentleman that at the last
election, it was not the Conservative party

94
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,640
that was refusing to guarantee funding for
the NHS; it was the Labour party.

95
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:09,279
>>Jeremy Corbyn: In six years, the NHS has
gone from surplus to the worst crisis in its

96
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:17,279
history. A total of £3 billion was wasted
on a top-down reorganisation that no one wanted,

97
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,430
and Simon Stevens made it very clear to the
Select Committee yesterday that he did not

98
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,640
believe that NHS England had enough money
to get through the crisis that it is facing.

99
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,920
May I offer an analysis from the Care Quality
Commission, which seems to have quite a good

100
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,130
grasp of what is going on? It says that cuts
in adult social care are

101
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:45,160
“translating to increased A&E attendances,
emergency admissions and delays to people

102
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,089
leaving hospital, which in turn is affecting
the ability of a growing number of trusts

103
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,700
to meet their performance and financial targets.”

104
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Will the Prime Minister also address the reckless
and counterproductive adult social care cuts

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,220
that were made by her predecessor?

106
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,899
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
quoted what had been said by Simon Stevens,

107
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,250
the chief executive of NHS England. At the
time of the autumn statement last November,

108
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,529
he said that “our case for the NHS has been
heard and actively supported.”

109
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:20,410
The right hon. Gentleman also raised the question
of social care, and the interaction between

110
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,910
healthcare and social care. More than £5
billion extra was put into the better care

111
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,940
fund in order to deal with precisely those
issues, and local authorities are able to

112
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:38,260
raise 2% of council tax to deal with the social
care costs that they face. What is important,

113
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,970
however, is for the health service and local
authorities to work together to ensure that

114
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,361
they deliver the best possible service to
people who require that social care. I saw

115
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:55,260
a very good example of that at Salford Royal
on Monday, and I want to see more examples

116
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,060
throughout the national health service, delivering
for patients. We have put in the funding,

117
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,610
which the right hon. Gentleman’s party would
not have done, so that the NHS will receive

118
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,000
better care for patients.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,209
>>Jeremy Corbyn: We all want local government
and the NHS to work closely together, but

120
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:17,570
the problem is that local government funding
has been cut, and 400,000 fewer people are

121
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,990
receiving publicly funded social care as a
result. The NHS is having difficulty coping

122
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:31,060
with the crisis that it is in, and unfortunately
there is bed-blocking. Acute patients cannot

123
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,951
leave, because no social care is available
for them somewhere down the line. The issue

124
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:43,320
is a funding crisis in both the NHS and local
government. Figures published by NHS trusts

125
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,630
show that the total deficit is £2.45 billion,
but the chief executive of NHS Providers says

126
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,709
that the figure may be even bigger. The Government
are disguising the extent of the crisis through

127
00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:07,380
temporary bailouts. [Interruption.] They are
bailing out trusts in a crisis. That is, of

128
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:16,019
course, a good thing, but why are the trusts
in 

129
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,040
a crisis in the first place?

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,520
Next month, sustainability and transformation
plans are going to be published. Many people

131
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,449
across the country are quite alarmed by this
because of the threat to accident and emergency

132
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:39,709
departments. Will the Prime Minister deal
with this issue now by quite simply saying

133
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:45,930
there will be no downgrades and no closures
of A&E departments in the statement coming

134
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,290
out next month?

135
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,339
>>The Prime Minister: I say to the right hon.
Gentleman that over the course of this Parliament,

136
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,899
the Government will be spending over half
a trillion pounds on the national health service.

137
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,300
That is a record level of investment in our
national health service. There is a key difference

138
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,510
between the way the right hon. Gentleman approaches
this and how I approach it: Conservative Members

139
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,780
believe that people at a local level should
be able to make decisions about the national

140
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,480
health service, and that decisions about the
national health service should be led by clinicians—it

141
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,889
should not be a top-down approach, which is
typical of the Labour party.

142
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:35,870
>>Jeremy Corbyn: Wow! Well, top-down was what
we got. It cost £3 billion for a reorganisation

143
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,550
that nobody wanted at all.

144
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:46,240
I started by asking the Prime Minister about
parity of esteem. All this Government have

145
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,680
produced is parity of failure—failing mental
health patients; failing elderly people who

146
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,639
need social care; failing the 4 million on
NHS waiting lists; failing the five times

147
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,209
as many people who are waiting more than four
hours at A&E departments—and another winter

148
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:10,839
crisis is looming. The Society for Acute Medicine
has it right when it says that this funding

149
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:18,339
crisis and the local government funding crisis
are leaving the NHS “on its knees”.

150
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:25,830
>>The Prime Minister: What has happened in
the NHS over the past six years? More patients

151
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,860
being treated, more calls to the ambulance
service, more operations, more doctors, more

152
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,040
nurses—that is what has been happening in
the NHS. But let us just look at the right

153
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,830
hon. Gentleman’s party’s approach to the
national health service: a former shadow Health

154
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,920
Secretary said that it would be “irresponsible”
to put more money into the national health

155
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,571
service; and a former leader of the Labour
party wanted to “weaponise” the national

156
00:14:54,571 --> 00:15:03,720
health service. At every election the Labour
party claims that the Conservatives will cut

157
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:14,180
NHS spending; after every election we increase
NHS spending. At every election Labour claims

158
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,199
the Tories will privatise the NHS; after every
election when we have been in government we

159
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,980
have protected the NHS. There is only one
party that has cut funding for the NHS: the

160
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,670
Labour party in Wales.

161
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:44,000
>>Marcus Fysh (Yeovil) (Con): Is the Prime
Minister aware that research shows that infrastructure

162
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,310
investment most benefits areas that are prepared
to capitalise on it with new associated possibilities

163
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,170
for housing, skills and jobs? Will she ensure
that current opportunities are taken for inward

164
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,449
investment to preserve and re-energise essential
national industries such as rotorcraft in

165
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:06,320
the Yeovil area as we seek to capitalise on
the dualling of the A303?

166
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,380
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely
right. We are right to invest in infrastructure

167
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,370
such as the A303. That can make a real difference
to local communities, but it is important

168
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,350
that local communities embrace those opportunities.
I know that my hon. Friend has been putting

169
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,680
together ideas for a vision for Yeovil and
I am sure he will share them with my right

170
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,290
hon. Friend the Communities Secretary.

171
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,490
>>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP): I join the
Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour

172
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,070
party in remembering the Aberfan disaster.
Our thoughts are with everyone affected by

173
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,180
that.

174
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,899
Thousands of innocent civilians have now been
killed by Saudi air strikes in Yemen. Can

175
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,589
the Prime Minister assure the House that those
civilians have not been killed by Paveway

176
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,040
IV missiles partially manufactured in Scotland
that are under licence from her Government

177
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
to Saudi Arabia?

178
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,360
>>The Prime Minister: First, may I congratulate
the right hon. Gentleman on his election as

179
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,980
deputy leader of the Scottish National party?
As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we have

180
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,630
one of the toughest regimes in the world in
relation to arms exports. When allegations

181
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,640
arise, we press—I have pressed in the past
and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary

182
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,290
has pressed—the Saudi Arabia Government
to properly investigate the issues and to

183
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,830
learn lessons from them.

184
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,140
>>Angus Robertson: I thank the Prime Minister
for her kind wishes but, to return to the

185
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,840
subject of my question, it is beyond doubt
that Saudi air forces are bombing Yemen. Planes

186
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,260
made in Britain are being flown by pilots
who were trained by Britain and dropping missiles

187
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,460
that are made in Britain. I asked her a direct
question and she could not answer it, so I

188
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,180
will try a second time. Can she give the House
an assurance that civilians have not been

189
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:01,200
killed by Paveway IV bombs being dropped on
Yemen that are partially manufactured in Scotland

190
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,850
under license by her Government? If she does
not know the answer to that question, how

191
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,840
can she possibly, in good conscience, continue
selling them to Saudi Arabia?

192
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,760
>>The Prime Minister: In response to the right
hon. Gentleman, the point that I made was

193
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,930
very simple: we press for proper investigations
into what has happened in those incidents

194
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:31,720
before we reach a decision or a conclusion.
We have a very strong relationship with Saudi

195
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,070
Arabia, which is important for this country
in terms of dealing with counter-terrorism

196
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,510
and a number of other issues, but what matters,
when incidents happen about which there is

197
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,990
concern, is that they are properly investigated.

198
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,340
>>Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) (Con): A
few weeks ago I thought that I had successfully

199
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,710
bought four tickets online for one of my favourite
bands, Green Day, only to be told that the

200
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:01,040
tickets were unavailable and the gig was sold
out, but within minutes I could buy the tickets

201
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,200
on another site, for twice the price. It turns
out that the ticket site had been the victim

202
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,550
of a computerised attack by organised touts
who then resell tickets at inflated prices.

203
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,370
Will the Prime Minister ask her Ministers
to give close consideration to my amendment

204
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,630
to the Digital Economy Bill that would make
the computerised harvesting of tickets for

205
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,020
resale an offence? Similar legislation exists
elsewhere, and it would go a long way towards

206
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,780
protecting consumers and genuine music fans.

207
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,440
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising that issue. I am sure that he

208
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,330
is not the only Member of the House who has
had that experience, and he is certainly not

209
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,630
the only person who has been affected, as
Members will know from their constituency

210
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:53,650
mailbags. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 introduced
a review of online ticket sales. Professor

211
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:00,670
Mike Waterson’s independent report on online
secondary ticketing makes a number of recommendations,

212
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,080
including some whereby the industry itself
could better protect itself from the problem.

213
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,170
The Government will look very carefully at
those recommendations to see what can be done

214
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,180
to address the issue.

215
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,090
>>Lisa Nandy (Wigan) (Lab): The child abuse
inquiry needs to regain the trust of survivors.

216
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,640
In September, the Home Secretary said that
she had no information about serious leadership

217
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,850
failings, but on Monday she told the House
that she had known about serious problems

218
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,430
since July. Yesterday it emerged that senior
Home Office officials were briefed as early

219
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:44,140
as April. The Prime Minister set up the inquiry
and appointed the chair. She was the individual

220
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,960
responsible for the inquiry’s success. She
was the Home Secretary in April and the only

221
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,580
person who had the power to act. Will she
now finally tell us when she personally learned

222
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:04,000
of the serious problems developing in the
inquiry, and why she took no action at all?

223
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,500
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise that the
hon. Lady has taken a particular interest

224
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,260
in this issue. I am sure that she will recognise,
as I hope other Members do, why it was that

225
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,990
I set up the inquiry. For too long, people
who had been subjected to child—[Interruption.]

226
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,150
>>Mr Speaker: Order.

227
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:27,200
>>The Prime Minister: For too long, the voices
of people who had been subjected to child

228
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,430
sexual abuse went unheard and they felt that
they were not getting justice. That is why

229
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:40,480
it is very important that the inquiry is able
to continue and to find that justice for them.

230
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,880
I have to say to the hon. Lady that one of
the important aspects of this is that, over

231
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,330
the years, too many people have had concerns
that those in positions of power have intervened

232
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:01,300
to stop them getting justice. There were stories
around about the inquiry and about individuals

233
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:08,460
related to the inquiry, but the Home Secretary
cannot intervene on the basis of suspicion,

234
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,960
rumour or hearsay.

235
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,230
The hon. Lady refers to the statement that
was made in this House yesterday about information

236
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,740
being discussed with a director general at
the Home Office. She will also have noted

237
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,220
that it was asked that that conversation would
be confidential, and it was, as far as I am

238
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,060
aware, treated as such. It is important for
us to recognise that when the Home Office

239
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:44,110
was officially informed of issues, it acted.
It is now for the inquiry to get on and deliver

240
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,500
for victims and survivors.

241
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:53,090
>>Mrs Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham)
(Con): Having been born in and grown up in

242
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,210
south Wales, and as a former Secretary of
State for Wales, may I associate myself with

243
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:03,200
the heartfelt tributes paid by Members on
the Front Bench and throughout this House

244
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,960
to the valley community of Aberfan? That absolutely
unparalleled tragedy stunned the world. Will

245
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,120
the Prime Minister now step up to the plate,
to use her own words, reconfirm her commitment

246
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,580
to Wales and ensure that her Government work
with the Welsh Government, particularly after

247
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,750
leaving the EU, to maintain the investment
that is so vital to the long-term social and

248
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,570
economic development of the valleys communities
and the rest of Wales?

249
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:36,670
>>The Prime Minister: As a former Secretary
of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend is

250
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:44,630
well aware of the impact of the Aberfan disaster
on south Wales and those local communities.

251
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,260
As I said in my opening remarks, the events
were absolutely tragic and the thoughts of

252
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,660
the whole House are with those affected by
them. I can give the commitment that she is

253
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,800
asking for to Wales and to working with the
Welsh Government. I am clear that this Government

254
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,630
will deliver a country that works for everyone,
and that means every part of the United Kingdom.

255
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,680
Of course, the Wales Bill will put in place
a historic transfer of powers to the Welsh

256
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,970
Assembly. It will allow the Welsh Government
to focus on the job of transforming the Welsh

257
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,550
economy and, of course, we are talking to
the Welsh Government about how we go forward

258
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,630
with negotiations for leaving the EU.

259
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,430
>>Mr Speaker: Order. Progress today has been
very slow, so I appeal to colleagues to speed

260
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,850
up. I call Stephen Pound.

261
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:36,130
>>Stephen Pound (Ealing North) (Lab): I am
much obliged, Mr Speaker. Can there be a single

262
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:41,290
Member of this House who does not have reason
to be grateful to those heroes of our high

263
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:47,420
street, community pharmacists? Can there be
any member of the public who is not as bemused

264
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,280
as I am that the Government are proposing
a 12% cut in the community pharmacy budget,

265
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,670
potentially leading to 3,000 closures? Will
the Prime Minister express her support for

266
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:09,490
community pharmacies and have another look
at this divisive, corrosive and destructive

267
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,490
proposal?

268
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:17,020
>>The Prime Minister: Everybody in this House
recognises the role and contribution of community

269
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,560
pharmacies up and down the country, but it
is also right that we look at how we are spending

270
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,980
NHS money. That is why the Government are
looking carefully at this whole issue. If

271
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,661
the hon. Gentleman supports community pharmacies,
perhaps he ought to have a word with the Leader

272
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:37,930
of the Opposition, because his right hon.
Friend’s policy is to nationalise the health

273
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:42,480
service completely, lock, stock and barrel—GP
surgeries, Macmillan nurses and community

274
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
pharmacies.

275
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,020
>>Richard Fuller (Bedford) (Con): May I welcome
the fact that next week this Government will

276
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,410
finally make a decision on airport capacity
in the south-east, which eluded three of my

277
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,230
right hon. Friend’s predecessors and will
help to boost trade? Does the Prime Minister

278
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,230
agree that, on this issue, substance matters
more than symbolism, and will she outline

279
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,800
to the House her timetable for implementation?

280
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,320
>>The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend
for raising this issue, and he is absolutely

281
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,520
right. This month, the Government will take
a decision on the appropriate site for extended

282
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,030
airport capacity in the south-east. The subject
has been debated, discussed and speculated

283
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,880
about for 40 years; this Government will take
a decision, but then a formal process has

284
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,680
to be undertaken. The Government will identify
their preferred site option. That will go

285
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,950
to a statutory consultation, and then the
Government will consider the results of that

286
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,580
consultation and introduce an airports national
planning statement on which the House will

287
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
vote.

288
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,270
>>Drew Hendry (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey) (SNP): Does the Prime Minister

289
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,540
agree that any move to close the historical
barracks at Fort George would be not only

290
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,420
a poor military decision after 250 years of
service, but a betrayal of the Black Watch

291
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,670
and a slap in the face to the highlands?

292
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:09,360
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise the strength
of the hon. Gentleman’s view. No decisions

293
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,510
on Fort George or other locations have been
taken and the Ministry of Defence will engage

294
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:19,950
with all parties impacted by any such decisions,
including in Scotland.

295
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:27,110
>>Mr Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con): My
right hon. Friend has expressed reluctance

296
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,300
to submit to the House even the broad plans
for our negotiations with the EU because of

297
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,250
worries that to do so might weaken her Government’s
negotiating position. She might have noticed

298
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,370
that, this week, one or more Brexiteer members
of her Cabinet have been briefing the newspapers

299
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:50,640
copiously on every proposal being put forward
in papers to the relevant Cabinet Committee

300
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,540
by their colleagues and launching political
attacks on Cabinet colleagues who seem to

301
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,880
disagree with them. Will she take firm action
to stop this process? Does she also agree

302
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,900
that the proper approach should involve parliamentary
scrutiny of the broad strategy, once her Government

303
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,740
have reached agreement on what it should be?

304
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:19,970
>>The Prime Minister: The Government are very
clear that the vote on 23 June was a vote

305
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,120
to ensure that we had control of movement
of people from the EU into the UK. Also, we

306
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,841
want the best possible access for businesses
for trading in goods and services, and for

307
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:35,800
operating within the European market. That
is what the Government will be aiming for,

308
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,530
and we will be ambitious in that. Parliament
will have its say. There are going to be lengthy

309
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,660
negotiations over the course of the two years
and more, and Parliament will have its say

310
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,200
in a whole variety of ways, not least in relation
to the great repeal Bill.

311
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,620
>>Maria Eagle (Garston and Halewood) (Lab):
Some of my constituents who have had their

312
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,340
tax credits suddenly stopped by Concentrix
have been accused of being in a relationship

313
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,120
with the previous tenants of their homes,
even though they have never met them, and

314
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,350
in some cases of being in a relationship with
members of their own families and told to

315
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:15,840
prove that they are not. This Kafkaesque situation
is causing deep distress and hardship among

316
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,890
working mothers in my constituency. Is this
what the Prime Minister means by being on

317
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,770
the side of working people? What is she going
to do to put this right?

318
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:32,380
>>The Prime Minister: The hon. Lady raises
an issue that is a matter of concern to Members

319
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,580
across the House. I am making sure that those
who are being assessed are being assessed

320
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,140
properly and that the right decisions are
being taken. The Department for Work and Pensions

321
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,470
is looking at the whole process of what should
be done and how those assessments should be

322
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:55,660
undertaken. I hope that she welcomes the fact
that this Government have said that those

323
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,070
with long-term conditions that are not going
to improve will not be put through the regular

324
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,630
assessments that they had under her Labour
Government.

325
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,520
>>Rebecca Pow (Taunton Deane) (Con): The first
nuclear science degree apprenticeship, with

326
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,650
apprenticeships with EDF at Hinkley Point
and with the Ministry of Defence, has just

327
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,980
been launched at Bridgwater and Taunton College.
This is at the forefront of the Government’s

328
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,250
apprenticeship reform policy. The course combines
academic study with practical work experience

329
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,580
and it is paid. Does the Prime Minister agree
that this is exactly the kind of business-led

330
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,000
course that the nation needs if it is to forge
ahead?

331
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,420
>>The Prime Minister: I absolutely agree with
my hon. Friend. I commend Bridgwater and Taunton

332
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,040
College for the steps it is taking to work
with businesses to ensure that its courses

333
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,900
are what business needs. That is exactly what
we want to see. We also want a regeneration

334
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,010
of our expertise in the nuclear industry.

335
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,410
>>Anne McLaughlin (Glasgow North East) (SNP):
The Prime Minister recently celebrated her

336
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:08,290
60th birthday, but she is not going to retire.
That is her choice, but she is denying that

337
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:14,130
same choice to many of my constituents, including
women such as Christine from Springburn, who

338
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,100
has worked every bit as hard as the Prime
Minister, but will now have to work for an

339
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,540
extra six years. When will the Prime Minister
do the right thing and give the WASPI women

340
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,790
their transitional arrangements so that they,
too, can make the choices that she enjoys?

341
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,620
>>The Prime Minister: I am sure that the hon.
Lady knows that we have transitional arrangements

342
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,030
in place and that action was taken by the
Government to ensure that the period of time

343
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,710
for the pension age change would be no more
than 18 months compared with the previous

344
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:50,290
timetable. For 81% of women affected by the
2011 change, it will be no more than 12 months.

345
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,640
>>Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):
The employment figures that have come out

346
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,670
today are of course fantastic news, but I
am wary about the economic volatility that

347
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,780
could result from Brexit, with the potential
for inflation to rise and the cost of living

348
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,742
to go up for people on very modest wages.
Does the Prime Minister agree that we need

349
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:14,130
to keep as many people in employment as possible?
We have made the right decision on tax credits.

350
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,910
May I urge her personally, ahead of the autumn
statement, to look at the cuts that are still

351
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,650
embedded in universal credit to ensure that
she understands what they will do to people

352
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,120
who are trying to get into work?

353
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,450
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is right
to talk about the importance of getting people

354
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,630
into work, which has a benefit not just in
terms of families having an income. I am proud

355
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,450
of the Conservative Government’s record
over the past six years of getting more and

356
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,760
more people into work so that hundreds of
thousands fewer households now have no work

357
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,230
income coming in. That is extremely important.
The point of universal credit is to ensure

358
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:58,240
that the transition from benefits into work
means that people do see a benefit if they

359
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,120
get into the workplace. The previous system
meant that some people said that they were

360
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,600
better off on benefits. We want to see people
in work and that is what the system is there

361
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
to encourage.

362
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,640
>>Alison Thewliss (Glasgow Central) (SNP):
I have been asking questions for 15 months

363
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,380
about this Tory Government’s appalling two-child
policy and rape clause, but the Government

364
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,200
still do not know how it will work. From one
feminist to another, can the Prime Minister

365
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,002
tell me how she justifies putting vulnerable
women through the trauma of proving that their

366
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:31,140
third child was born as the result of rape?

367
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,640
>>The Prime Minister: We have been clear that
women who have a third child as a result of

368
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,670
rape would not be subject to the limit that
is being considered in relation to benefits.

369
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:51,840
I absolutely recognise that the hon. Lady’s
point addresses concern about dealing with

370
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,640
individuals who have been through the trauma
of rape, and that is why the Government are

371
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,480
taking their time to consider that. We are
consulting at the moment and looking at how

372
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,920
to ensure that we do this in absolutely the
right way.

373
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,040
>>Sir Hugo Swire (East Devon) (Con): Given
the increasing relevance of the Commonwealth

374
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,080
for trade, will the Prime Minister give her
personal support to the first ever meeting

375
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,389
of Commonwealth Trade Ministers here in the
UK next year? When she goes to India next

376
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,160
month, will she commit to persuade Prime Minister
Modi to attend the 2018 Commonwealth Heads

377
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,379
of Government meeting in the UK?

378
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:35,270
>>The Prime Minister: I am happy to encourage
all leaders to attend CHOGM when it takes

379
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,040
place here in the United Kingdom. I assure
my right hon. Friend that we are indeed looking

380
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,150
at the possibility of trade deals in relation
to the Commonwealth. I applaud that first

381
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:49,910
ever meeting of Commonwealth Trade Ministers,
which is an important step as we look to forge

382
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,019
a new global role in the world, ensuring that
we make a success of leaving the EU and trading

383
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,490
our way around the world.

384
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,701
>>Mr Jamie Reed (Copeland) (Lab): Local clinicians
are absolutely clear that the removal of 24-hour

385
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:05,420
consultant-led maternity services from the
West Cumberland hospital in Whitehaven will

386
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,990
cost lives. Ultimately, it is a decision that
the Government will have to make. Will the

387
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,630
Prime Minister please commit today to visit
my constituency to see what the effect of

388
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,290
the decision will be on west Cumbrian families,
women and children?

389
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:25,140
>>The Prime Minister: I recognise that this
is not the first time that the hon. Gentleman

390
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,640
has raised concerns about West Cumberland
hospital. The point of how we are approaching

391
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,500
this is that decisions are taken at and generated
from the local level. It is the local area

392
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,030
that will be looking at the services that
people need, and at ensuring that they can

393
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:47,270
be provided and are safe for his constituents
and those in other parts of Cumbria.

394
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,502
>>Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):
The tragic murder of one prisoner and the

395
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:57,110
critical wounding of two others at Pentonville
prison last night brings home the stark decline

396
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:02,070
in safety in our prisons. Will the Prime Minister
give the Secretary of State for Justice her

397
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,700
full support in commissioning an immediate,
thorough and complete review of the operation,

398
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,410
management, capacity, leadership and resourcing
of the National Offender Management Service,

399
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,140
which has singularly failed to arrest this
declining situation?

400
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:21,080
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
a matter that was one of the first issues

401
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,410
that my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor
and Secretary of State for Justice raised

402
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,460
with me: violence and safety in prisons. That
is why my right hon. Friend is looking across

403
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,320
the board at the action that needs to be taken.
She has already announced extra money for

404
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,960
more staff in prisons and recognises the importance
of this particular issue.

405
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,950
>>Lucy Powell (Manchester Central) (Lab/Co-op):
Just one in every 1,000 pupils is a child

406
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,760
on free school meals in a grammar school.
Does the Prime Minister agree that that tiny

407
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,731
number is a flimsy evidence base on which
to create a new national schools policy? Would

408
00:36:57,731 --> 00:37:02,310
it not be better for her to look at the real
evidence base and at how to reduce inequality

409
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,310
in education?

410
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:08,490
>>The Prime Minister: I want to see every
child getting the education that is right

411
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:15,260
for them. I want every child to be able to
get on as far as their talents and hard work

412
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:23,540
will take them. That is why we need to increase
the number of good schools in this country.

413
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:31,050
If we look at the gap in attainment in grammar
schools between those who are from disadvantaged

414
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,830
backgrounds and those who are not, we see
that it is virtually zero—that is the not

415
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:42,801
the same in other schools. I just say to the
hon. Lady that it is wrong that we have a

416
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:48,810
system in this country where a law prevents
the opening or expansion of good schools.

417
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,420
That is what we are going to get rid of.

418
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,100
>>Pauline Latham (Mid Derbyshire) (Con): Will
the Prime Minister work with her Ministers

419
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:02,390
and Secretaries of State to champion a reduction
in the ivory trade and in the trade in the

420
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:08,760
organs of endangered species throughout the
world so that this country tries to lead by

421
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
example?

422
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,770
>>The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises
an important issue. This is something the

423
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,820
Government have been taking up, and I can
assure her that my right hon. Friend the Foreign

424
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,130
Secretary has not only heard her representations,
but promoted this as an issue that the Government

425
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,130
will take up.

426
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,570
>>Robert Flello (Stoke-on-Trent South) (Lab):
The pottery industry is witnessing a modest

427
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:37,760
renaissance, in part through EU exports and
EU action on Chinese ceramic dumping. The

428
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,081
previous Prime Minister said that he would
make sure that the ceramic industry’s voice

429
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:47,130
is heard and that we would get a good negotiation.
What is this Prime Minister doing to ensure

430
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:52,541
that Stoke-on-Trent’s ceramic manufacturers
maintain both tariff-free access to the EU

431
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:57,960
and a level playing field in the face of protectionist
dumping?

432
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:05,200
>>The Prime Minister: I am very pleased to
welcome the renaissance in the ceramics industry

433
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,961
that the hon. Gentleman refers to. His constituency,
of course, has a long-standing history of

434
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:14,430
and tradition in ceramics. What are we doing?
As we go through the negotiations for leaving

435
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,510
the European Union, we will be ensuring that
this country has the best possible access

436
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,610
to trade with and operate within that European
market. That is what people want and that

437
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,740
is what we will deliver.

438
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,880
>>Oliver Dowden (Hertsmere) (Con): Many constituents
have contacted me to express concern about

439
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,450
anti-Semitism. I am sure that every Member
of this House can agree that we should show

440
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:39,720
zero tolerance of anti-Semitism, but does
the Prime Minister also agree that we must

441
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,260
ensure that all parties do not allow a situation
to arise in which it appears that an environment

442
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,340
is created where anti-Semitism is tolerated?

443
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:56,380
>>The Prime Minister: Yes, I absolutely agree
with my hon. Friend that this House should

444
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,470
send a very clear message that we will not
tolerate anti-Semitism. I have been concerned

445
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,840
about the rise in the number of incidents
of anti-Semitism in this country. We should

446
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,900
very clearly ensure that those incidents of
anti-Semitism are properly investigated and

447
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,120
dealt with, and that we give the clear message
that we will not tolerate it. But that does

448
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:22,880
have to be done by every single political
party in this Chamber, and I say to the Leader

449
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,130
of the Opposition that given the report of
the Home Affairs Committee about anti-Semitism

450
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,670
and the approach to anti-Semitism in the Labour
party, he needs to think very carefully about

451
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,720
the environment that has been created in the
Labour party in relation to anti-Semitism.

452
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,090
>>Andy Burnham (Leigh) (Lab): We are now just
one month from the start of the new inquest

453
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,050
into the Birmingham pub bombings. West Midlands
police has set aside for itself a legal fund

454
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,940
of £1 million, but as of today, the bereaved
families have no legal funding. Prime Minister,

455
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,260
this is a shameful state of affairs. Please
intervene and show the Birmingham families

456
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,150
the same compassion as was shown to the Hillsborough
families.

457
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:10,250
>>The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman
might be aware that the Birmingham families

458
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,790
have been encouraged to apply—I believe
they have applied—to the legal aid fund

459
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:20,110
for exceptional funding. That was, as I understand
it, what happened after the 7/7 bombings.

460
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,440
The Home Secretary has made clear her expectation
that funding will be provided. We are waiting

461
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,590
for the decision from the legal aid fund,
and we are hopeful that it will be a positive

462
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,590
one.

463
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,680
>>Mrs Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con):
Why attempt to build a new runway at Heathrow

464
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,760
when we could deliver one at Gatwick in half
the time, for half the cost and with a fraction

465
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,720
of the environmental impact?

466
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:46,520
>>The Prime Minister: I assure my right hon.
Friend that no decision has been taken on

467
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,700
the site of airport expansion in the south-east.
As she will know from her previous background,

468
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,710
the Davies commission said that airport capacity
in the south-east should be expanded and the

469
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,470
Government accepted that argument. The Davies
commission identified three sites, all of

470
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,160
which it said would be credible and deliverable,
and the Government will take a decision this

471
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
month.

472
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,890
>>Mr Speaker: It is fitting that we finish
with a question from Mr Gerald Jones.

473
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:15,540
>>Gerald Jones (Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)
(Lab): May I thank the Prime Minister, the

474
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,810
Leader of the Opposition and other Members
for their comments about the Aberfan disaster,

475
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:26,040
and about the resilience and quiet dignity
shown by the people of Aberfan? At 9.15 on

476
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,730
Friday morning—the anniversary of the disaster—the
people in that community and communities across

477
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:41,080
Wales will mark the disaster with a minute’s
silence. As the disaster affected communities

478
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:49,250
right across the country, if not the world,
will the Prime Minister support that minute’s

479
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,760
silence being marked across the UK as well?

480
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
>>The Prime Minister:

481
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,540
I know that the Secretary of State for Wales
will be attending the memorial that will take

482
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,240
place in the hon. Gentleman’s constituency
on Friday. It is appropriate that we all show

483
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,090
our respect for those who lost their lives
and for the families who suffered as a result

484
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:12,570
of the Aberfan tragedy 50 years ago. As we
said earlier, it was a terrible tragedy not

485
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:17,370
just for individual families, but for a whole
community, and it is right that we recognise

486
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,260
that and mark it.
